P300 is a positive ERP component that occurs 300 ms after the presentation of a rare stimulus and indicates conscious perception of an unexpected change in sensory stimulation. Since the amplitude of ERPs is comparable to that of background electroencephalography, the most widespread approach to render ERPs correctly detectable is time-domain averaging. ERPs are physiologically affected by variations in latency, referred to as latency jitter. The most promising techniques to address latency jitter are cross-correlation template matching algorithms, which estimate single-trial latencies and resynchronize them according to a template that best describes the ERP component. Adaptive Wavelet Filtering (AWF) is an algorithm applied in the wavelet domain to provide the optimal compromise of time-frequency resolution in detecting ERPs. The choice of an appropriate decomposition frequency is crucial in the application of AWF, as it is essential for identifying the correct template and estimating single-trial latencies. In this study, we investigated the influence of frequency on the performance of AWF to optimize it. The algorithm was tested on simulated data with varying latency shifts and signal-to-noise ratios as well as for data recorded from 11 healthy subjects during an auditory oddball paradigm. Results on both simulated and real EEG data showed how frequency decomposition of 3 Hz is the most appropriate for P300 waveform detection.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782005","Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782005","Event Related Potentials;Latency Jitter;Adaptive Wavelet Filtering;EEG;P300","Time-frequency analysis;Wavelet domain;Jitter;Electroencephalography;Physiology;Frequency estimation;Time-domain analysis;Signal resolution;Optimization;Signal to noise ratio","Algorithms;Humans;Event-Related Potentials, P300;Electroencephalography;Wavelet Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","9","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though a number of studies reported in literature have identified stress/emotion using brain signals, investigation of stress with user's emotional response is rarely explored. In this study, our aim is to understand human stress based on emotional response of the users, using band power features extracted from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.

The impact of artifact reduction from EEG signals for the machine learningbased anxiety screening was investigated in this study. Here, the EEG data of 40 participants (aged between 18 and 25 years) was used; of these, 24 had anxiety and 16 did not. A novel algorithm for artifact removal was used to process the data. After extracting the Hjorth parameters, the SVM classifier was used.

Key questions are how to extract the ERP from on-going EEG with fewer average times and how to further decompose ERP into basic components related to cognitive process. In this paper we introduce a novel Blind Source Separation (BSS) approach based on a weak exclusion principle (WEP) to solve these problems. The superior aspect of this algorithm is that it is based on a deterministic principle, which is more appropriate to analyze non-stationary EEG signals than most other BSS methods based on statistical hypotheses. The results show that our BSS algorithm can quickly and effectively extract ERPs using fewer average times than the traditional averaging methods. We show that, via BSS, we can isolate two main ERP components, which are respectively related to an exogenous process and a cognitive process, and can discriminate between the occipital lobe and the frontal lobe responses from the brain, agreeing with the classical component modeling in ERPs. Single-trial ERP separation results have demonstrated the consistency of these two main ERP components. Thus, BSS based on WEP can provide a window to better understand ERP, not only in averaging behavior, but in the complexities of moment-to-moment dynamics as well.","1945-8452","978-1-5090-1172-8","10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950687","Blind Source Separation (BSS);Event- Related Potentials (ERP);Electroencephalogram (EEG);Weak Exclusion Principle (WEP)","Electroencephalography;Blind source separation;Electrodes;Electric potential;Brain modeling;Standards;Indexes","","1","","10","IEEE","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subjects (n=8), prepared, planned and exerted force with their right arm in horizontal plane, according to visual cues. Here we show that surface Laplacian, as a simple spatial filter can provide useful knowledge about the involved brain regions in different stages of the task. The results show that there is a negative peak at FCz in response to the preparation cue. The planning cue causes positive peaks at FCz and Pz followed by a sustained negativity at FCz. The GO cue leads to a a negative peak at FCz and a positive peak at Pz which is followed by a sustained positivity at C1. The results suggest that there is considerable involvement of pre-motor and parietal areas in different stages of motor preparation, planning and execution of isometric tasks. The results provide considerably local information on brain activity compared to ear-lobe referenced event-related potentials and favor the applicability of non-invasive EEG recordings and techniques to study motor neurophysiology when appropriately used in complex experimental setups.

The amplitude of the potentials is in the range of single microvolts. Unfortunately, the precision of such potential measures is low, because of existing “body” noises. Additionally, other brain activities and even human emotion variations can distort the result. Therefore, further researches of electrical properties must be continued. Today's measurement methods of olfactory evoked potentials need several repetition cycles to obtain average values of the necessary potential. Because it is necessary to take into account olfactory weariness (attenuation), a repetition frequency is low and as a consequence, a patient survey is long (usually 20-30 min. using existing equipment).","","978-83-63578-05-3","10.1109/MIXDES.2014.6872253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872253","event-related potentials (ERP);olfactory system diagnosis;brain activity;microprocessor","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Electric potential;Diseases;Distortion measurement;Noise","","1","","11","","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple temporal features are extracted from the two resting states, and the relationship between the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and the temporal features is studied. It is found that the temporal features are different in five brain regions between the eye-open and eye-close states. The mean value, the trimmean values, the iqr values, the mad values and the standard deviation of EEG data during eye-close state are higher than these temporal features during eye-open state. Meanwhile, there are differences for the median values and the skewness values between the eye-open and eye-close conditions for five brain regions. Besides, it is found that the STAI is negatively correlated with iqr values, mad values and std values in the right part of the brain under the eye-open condition, but positively correlated with the skewness values under the eye-close condition. These results demonstrate the possibility of using the temporal features to identify the normal subject's anxiety level, which also provide evidence for the differences of resting EEG for eye-open and eye-close conditions and their relationship with STAI in time domain.","","978-1-7281-4852-6","10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8965982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8965982","Resting EEG;Temporal features;Correlation analysis;Anxiety","","","1","","49","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding the neural underpinnings of early depressive and anxiety symptoms carries significant diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Recent studies have highlighted the influence of gender on the neural correlates of mood disorders, yet the specific mechanisms for it remain unclear. Based on previous research that has highlighted the unresolved nature of how gender differences manifest in EEG neural patterns of emotions, this study aimed to investigate the EEG characteristics of the relationship between alpha frequency brainwaves and mood disorders, focusing specifically on females. Resting-state EEG recordings (eyes closed) were obtained from 10 female young adult subjects (mean age = $21.80 \pm 0.79)$. Additionally, all participants completed self-report measures assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. EEG power spectral measures in the alpha frequency band (8 to 12 Hz) were analyzed for 32 electrode locations across the scalp. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between occipital alpha activity and anxiety scores. However, contrary to expectations, no significant correlation was found between alpha activity and depression scores. These results suggest that lower occipital alpha activity is linked with higher anxiety scores in young adult females. This study provides preliminary evidence for the potential use of resting-state EEG occipital alpha power as an indicator of anxiety symptoms. Future research with larger samples and longitudinal designs is needed to validate these findings and clarify the neural mechanisms involved.","","979-8-3503-6450-7","10.1109/ICCSCE61582.2024.10696855","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10696855","Anxiety;EEG;Brainwaves;Female;Young adult","Correlation;Mood;Atmospheric measurements;Anxiety disorders;Scalp;Particle measurements;Depression;Electroencephalography;Frequency measurement;Stress measurement","","","","22","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, visual search task was chosen to stress subjects, and the brain activity was measured by using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and an electroencephalograph (EEG) was measured. Advantages of using these in combination are that it is relatively simple and less burdensome to the subject and it can be measured from the two viewpoints of neural activity and hemodynamics for the same brain region. As prior research, there are studies investigating the presence of stress by using brain activity, but there are no researches measuring the change in brain activity under continuous stress. The aim of this research is to extract features of active sites of brain function and electroencephalograms in stress accumulation. This research conducted experiments and analysis focusing on the two poles of Fp1 and Fp2 in international 10-20 method. In NIRS, when every time stress was accumulated, the difference was confirmed between right and left in brain activity. In EEG, there was no common feature between data in frequency and phase. From the above, it is possible to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the degree of stress accumulation by combining near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalograph by extracting a feature amount that changes every time stress accumulates in the EEG signal. As future tasks, the number of subjects should be increased. Also, different types of EEG analysis and the number of measurement points should be considered.","","978-1-5386-4662-5","10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8388667","stress;EEG;NIRS","Stress;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Stress measurement;Brain;Feature extraction;Coherence","","","","11","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the development of a LabVIEW-based system that can determine the level of stress based on the analysis of brain signals in LabView.

The eegID application in mobile phone is used to capture recorded EEG signals from EEG amplifier and then the captured EEG signals are analysed in LabView. The result shows that the average centroid which was applied on the EEG Power Spectrum of Alpha band is higher than Beta band when the subject is at relax cognitive state meanwhile the average centroid of EEG Power Spectrum of Beta band is higher than Alpha band when the subject is at stress cognitive state. Thus, it can be concluded that the subject are in the stress cognitive state when playing game and doing IQ test.

Conventionally, ERP is obtained by grand-averaging EEG recordings across multiple trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Reliable quantitative analysis of the amplitude or latency of ERP requires sufficient SNR. Estimating SNR thus offers a criterion for selecting the trial number in designing experiments and the ERP analysis. Unfortunately, most researchers miss assessing SNR, which leads to the reliability of the results being unchecked, particularly under a low SNR. Although a few SNR estimates for ERP have been proposed, their performances have not yet been well compared. As a result, researchers are still left without a guideline quantifying the quality of their ERP signals. An SNR estimate is considered superior if it more successfully differentiates the difference in noises. Using both simulated and actual ERP components, in this study, we aimed to compare the performances of four SNR estimates. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed from the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to quantify the performances of the SNR estimates in Task I: classifying ERP and spontaneous EEG and Task II: classifying the ERP with different levels of noises. Our results showed that the SNR estimate by calculating the ratio of the highest amplitude in the ERPs to the standard deviation in the baseline time interval (SNRMaidhof) was outstanding in Task I. While the SNR estimate by dividing the mean root square of the signal by the variance of the baseline (SNRM&P) was the best SNR estimate in Task II. These results provided a guideline for assessing the quality of the ERP, excluding experimental subjects, or designing the number of required trials before the quantitative analysis.Clinical Relevance— This study provides the rules of thumb for quantifying the ERP data quality, screening the subjects and designing the number of trials in ERP experiments.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340887","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340887","","Statistical analysis;Electroencephalography;Time measurement;Recording;Reliability;Task analysis;Standards","Humans;Electroencephalography;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Reproducibility of Results;Evoked Potentials;Computer Simulation","","","19","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, traditional diagnostic methods for anxiety disorders rely heavily on clinical DSM-IV scale screening. Functional connectivity networks as a new type of electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarker has been successfully applied to adolescent anxiety screening. Whereas the previous studies have only analyzed anxiety disorders from a single dimension, and easily overlooked the spatiotemporal covariation characteristics and physiological significance of frequency bands of EEG in anxiety disorders. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the group sparse canonical correlation analysis to joint feature learning (GSCCA JF) for accurate diagnosing and exploring the internal mechanism of the disease. The experimental results show that this method achieves good classification performances compared to other competing methods. In brief, the proposed method can be used to accurately screen and diagnose adolescent anxiety disorders at an early stage, which provides it clinical value.","1945-8452","978-1-6654-7358-3","10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10230594","Anxiety;electroencephalogram (EEG);Functional Connectivity Networks;Joint Feature Learning","Representation learning;Image recognition;Correlation;Anxiety disorders;Electroencephalography;Physiology;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","","","20","IEEE","1 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, ERPs are $\sim 1\mu \mathrm{V}$ signals embedded in the background of much stronger neural oscillations, and thus they are traditionally extracted by averaging hundreds of trial responses so that the neural oscillations can cancel out each other. However, often in cognitive science experiments, it is difficult to administer large number of trials due to physical constraints. Additionally, these excessive averaging can also blur fine structures of the ERPs signals, which might otherwise be indicative of various intrinsic factors. Here we propose to model the background oscillations using a novel oscillation state-space representation and identify their time-traces in a data-driven way. This allows us to effectively separate the oscillations from the response signals of interest, thus improving the signal-to-noise of the evoked response, and eventually increasing trial fidelity. We also consider a random-walk like continuity constraint for the ERP waveforms to recover smooth, de-noised estimates. We employ a generalized expectation maximization algorithm for estimating the model parameters, and then infer the approximate posterior distribution of ERP waveforms. We demonstrate the reduced reliance of our proposed ERP extraction technique via a simulation study. Finally, we showcase how the extracted ERPs using our method can be more informative than the traditional average-based ERPs when analyzing EEG data in cognitive task settings with fewer trials.","2576-2303","979-8-3503-2574-4","10.1109/IEEECONF59524.2023.10476951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476951","Event related potentials;neural oscillations;state-space model;variational approximation","Computers;Electric potential;Computational modeling;Neural activity;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;State-space methods","","","","28","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The human body acquires and responds to stress in different ways resulting to two classifications of stress namely, mental and emotional stress. Traditional methods in classifying stress such as through questionnaires and self-assessment tests are said to be subjective since they rely on personal judgment. Thus, in this study, stress is classified through an objective measure which is EEG signal analysis. The features of the EEG recordings are then pre-processed, extracted, and selected using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

MWL estimators based on spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown great potentials to achieve this goal. However, the previous studies show that the between-task robustness of these EEG/ERP-based MWL estimators is still an unsolved intractable question. This study attempts to examine the task-irrelevant auditory event-related potentials (tir-aERPs) as MWL indicators. A working memory task (verbal n-back) and a visuo-motor task (multi-attribute task battery, MATB), both with two difficulty levels (easy and hard), were used in the experiment, along with task-irrelevant auditory probes that did not need any response from the participants. EEG was recorded from ten participants when they were performing the tasks. The tir-aERPs elicited by the auditory probes were extracted and analyzed. The results show that the amplitudes of N1, early P3a (eP3a) and the late reorienting negativity (RON) significantly decreased with the increasing MWL in both n-back and MATB. Task type has no obvious influence on the amplitudes and topological layout of the MWL-sensitive tir-aERPs features. These results suggest that the tir-aERPs are potentially more constant MWL indicators across very different task types. Therefore, the tir-aERPs should be taken into consideration in future task-independent MWL monitoring studies.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175957","electroencephalography (EEG);Mental Workload (MWL);Between-task Consistency;Event-related Potentials (ERP)","Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Monitoring;Electric potential;Probes;Resource management;Feature extraction","Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Memory, Short-Term;Workload","2","","20","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the phase-locked information of ERPs, the single-trial was split as the input of the network using the sliding window method.

Characterizing neural activity during video game interaction allows for naturalistic and engaging brain dynamics research. Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors capture neural signals with high temporal resolution noninvasively, making them ideal for studying real-time brain activity during dynamic tasks like gaming. Understanding the complex dynamical phenomena of EEG patterns corresponding to different neural activities requires nonlinear analysis and feature extraction. Phase space reconstruction (PSR) is a typical nonlinear technique used to reveal the dynamics of the brain's neural system. Recently, topological signal processing (TSP) has been utilized to explore the properties of phase space, providing a powerful tool for analyzing the phase space. In this letter, a novel topological EEG nonlinear dynamics analysis approach is proposed using PSR techniques to convert EEG sensor signals into phase space, with the persistent homology tool employed to explore the topological properties of phase space. The proposed approach is implemented and experimentally validated on a publicly available EEG-based mobile brain–body imaging dataset. The framework demonstrates its efficacy in characterizing neural activity during game interaction with average accuracy of 90.31% for model 1 (TP9 and TP10) and 93.49% for model 2 (all four channels), outperforming existing deep learning approaches.

Neuroimaging studies have previously highlighted the link between social impairment and brain activity in ASD. This study aims to develop a method for assessing and identifying ASD using a social cognitive game-based paradigm combined with electroencephalo-graphy (EEG) signaling features. Typically developing (TD) participants and autistic preadolescents and teenagers were recruited to participate in a social game while 12-channel EEG signals were recorded. The EEG signals underwent preprocessing to analyze local brain activities, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency features. Additionally, the global brain network’s functional connectivity between brain regions was evaluated using phase-lag indices (PLIs). Subsequently, machine learning models were employed to assess the neurophysiological features. Results indicated pronounced ERP components, particularly the late positive potential (LPP), in parietal regions during social training. Autistic preadolescents and teenagers exhibited lower LPP amplitudes and larger P200 amplitudes compared to TD participants. Reduced theta synchronization was also observed in the ASD group. Aberrant functional connectivity within certain time intervals was noted in the ASD group. Machine learning analysis revealed that support-vector machines achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.7%, and accuracy of 95.8% as part of the performance evaluation when utilizing ERP and brain oscillation features for ASD characterization. These findings suggest that social interaction difficulties in autism are linked to specific brain activation patterns.

However, a large amount of BCI data is required for deep learning, and data collection can be difficult. Therefore, we attempted to verify the applicability of BCI to transfer learning based on a considerable amount of data obtained from clinical examinations.

Standard electrode locations embedded within the hair result in challenges to obtaining quality signals in a rapid manner. Moreover, these sites require electrode gel, which can be inconvenient. As electrical activity in the brain is spatially volume distributed, it should be possible to predict ERPs from distant sensor locations at easily accessible mastoid and forehead scalp regions. Methods: An artificial neural network was trained on ERP signals recorded from below hairline electrode locations (Tp9, Tp10, Af7, Af8 referenced to Fp1, Fp2) to predict signals recorded at the ideal Cz location. Results: The model resulted in mean improvements in intraclass correlation coefficient relative to control for all stimulus types (Standard Tones: +9.74%, Deviant Tones: +3.23%, Congruent Words: +15.25%, Incongruent Words: +25.43%) and decreases in RMS Error (Standard Tones: −26.72%, Deviant Tones: −17.80%, Congruent Words: −28.78%, Incongruent Words: −29.61%) compared to the individual distant channels. Measured vs predicted ERP amplitudes were highly and significantly correlated with control for the N100 (R = 0.5, padj < 0.05), P300 (R = 0.75, padj < 0.01), and N400 (R = 0.75, padj < 0.01) ERPs. Conclusion: ERP waveforms at distant channels can be combined using a neural network autoencoder to model the control channel features with better precision than those at individual distant channels. This is the first demonstration of feasibility of predicting evoked potentials and brain vital signs using signals recorded from more distant, practical locations. Significance: This solves a key engineering challenge for applications that require portability, comfort, and speed of measurement as design priorities for measurement of event-related potentials across a range of individuals, settings, and circumstances.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2020.2973617","Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems(grant numbers:IT03240); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998180","Distant-sensing;brain vital signs;electroencephalography (EEG);event-related potentials (ERP);artificial neural network;machine learning","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Standards;Artificial neural networks;Mathematical model;Brain modeling;Electric potential","Brain;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Humans;Male;Scalp","4","","28","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proper ERP detection contributes to widening the scope of use and, in general, improving functionality. The morphology and latency of ERPs are variable among subject sessions, which complicates their detection. Although variability is an intrinsic feature of neuronal activity, it can be addressed with novel views on ERP detection techniques. In this paper, we propose an agile method for characterizing and thus detecting variable ERPs, which keeps track of their temporal and spatial information through the continuous measurement of the area under the curve in ERP components. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed ERP characterization for electrode selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and compare the results with other standard methods. We assess ERP classification for BCI use with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and cross-validation. We also evaluate performance with both the information transfer rate and BCI utility. The results of our validation tests show that this characterization helps to take advantage of the information on the evolution of positive and negative ERP components and, therefore, to efficiently select electrodes for optimized ERP detection. The proposed method improves the classification accuracy and bitrate of all sets of electrodes analyzed. Furthermore, the method is robust between different day sessions. Our work contributes to the efficient detection of ERPs, manages inter- and intrasubject variability, decreases the computational cost of classic detection methods and contributes to promoting low-cost personalized brain-computer interfaces.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000187","Predoctoral Research Grants of the Ecuador Government through of the Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENESCYT)(grant numbers:2015-AR2Q9086); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades/FEDER under the Spanish Government(grant numbers:TIN2017-84452-R,DPI2015-65833-P,PGC2018-095895-B-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109285","Personalized brain-computer interface;brain-machine interface;continuous ERP characterization;event-related potentials;inter- and intrasubject variability;negative ERP;online electrode selection;P300;positive ERP","Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Color;Brain-computer interfaces;Feature extraction;Computational efficiency","","9","","72","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to discriminate visual ERPs produced in alcoholics and controls within the beta band, SE features are applied to a k-NN classifier.

However, recent studies have found that the phase coherence of ongoing EEG oscillations is also related to stimulus-related brain activities and could reveal some information (e.g. phase-locked modulation in time-frequency domain) that ERPs could not provide. Here, we used inter-trail phase coherence(ITPC) to analyze the ongoing EEG oscillations under face/object stimuli, which aimed to explore the influence of face/object stimuli on EEG oscillations at various frequency bands (alpha, beta and low frequency gamma). Our preliminary results showed that (1) alpha band has relatively high phase synchronization in the time window of P1-N170-P2 under face/object stimuli; (2) EEG for face stimuli showed higher phase synchronization than object did in the time window of 80-350 ms in alpha band; (3) in low frequency gamma band, faces evoked relatively higher phase synchronization around 170ms than objects did. These results indicated that (1) ITPC, the measure of EEG phase synchronization, could be effectively used in face/object perception to provide oscillatory phase information; (2) the modulation of ITPC value in the alpha band might be more suitable to investigate the face preference EEG activities and locate the time range of the early face perception compared with ERPs; (3) the difference between face and object processing could be reflected in the low frequency gamma band via ITPC values.","1948-2922","978-1-4244-6498-2","10.1109/BMEI.2010.5640542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640542","electroencephalography;event-related potentials;face perception;object perception;inter-trial phase coherence","Face;Electroencephalography;Synchronization;Time frequency analysis;Oscillators;Frequency synchronization;Frequency modulation","","3","","20","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study demonstrated the significance of EEG and fNIRS signals in discriminating mental stress from baseline with p-value of 0.04 and 0.0014 respectively. We confirm that there is a correlation between EEG Alpha rhythm and concentration change of oxygenated hemoglobin with stress task. Using support vector machine (SVM), the detection rate of mental stress is 81%, and 95% using fNIRS and EEG respectively.","","978-1-4799-8996-6","10.1109/ICSIPA.2015.7412205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7412205","Stress;EEG;fNIRS;Correlation;SVM","Electroencephalography;Stress;Correlation;Rhythm;Hemodynamics;Support vector machines;Optical filters","","24","","25","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, this paper investigates the pattern in EEG signals when introduced with mental stress. Ten healthy volunteers played the Word search game for three distinct levels, whose aim was to search hidden words from the grid. The levels are chosen randomly. The EEG signals during gameplay are recorded to investigate the impacts of stress with the changing levels from easy to medium and hard. A total of 16 features of EEG are analyzed in this experiment which includes Power band features with relative powers, the ratio of band powers, Event-Related Desynchronization, and statistical features. Support Vector Machine classifier is used which gave an accuracy of 77.2% for three-level based stress analysis. For two levels, the accuracies of 78% 83.7% and 90% are achieved.","","978-1-6654-1836-2","10.1109/GCAT52182.2021.9587468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9587468","Brain computer interface (BCI);EEG;Stress analysis;Word search","Support vector machines;Neuroimaging;Entertainment industry;Games;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Stress","","8","","9","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we evaluated the resting-state global EEG connectivity as a potential biomarker for depressive and anxiety symptoms. For this, we evaluated a population of 119 subjects, including 75 healthy subjects and 44 patients with major depressive disorder. We calculated the global connectivity (spectral coherence) in a setup of 60 EEG channels, for six different spectral bands: theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, and gamma. These global connectivity scores were used to train a Support Vector Regressor to predict symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI). Experiments showed a significant prediction of both symptoms, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.07±6.98 and 11.52±8.7 points, respectively. Among the most discriminating features, the global connectivity in the alpha2 band (10.0-12.0Hz) presented significantly positive Spearman's correlation with the depressive (rho = 0.32, pFDR <; 0.01), and the anxiety symptoms (rho = 0.26, pFDR<; 0.01).Clinical relevance-This study demonstrates that EEG global connectivity can be used to predict depression and anxiety symptoms measured by widely used questionnaires.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176161","","Electroencephalography;Biomarkers;Coherence;Correlation;Support vector machines;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Databases","Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Electroencephalography;Humans","5","","41","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, several studies make an effort to recognize individuals' stress using an Electroencephalogram (EEC). However, current EEC-based stress recognition frameworks have several drawbacks. First, they are mostly designed to recognize individuals' stress only in a controlled laboratory environment. Second, they do not take into account the changes in the EEC signals of different subjects under the same stressors. Third, most of the current stress recognition algorithms occur in an offline setting. To address these issues, this study proposes an EEC-based stress recognition framework that takes into account each subject's brainwave patterns to train the stress recognition classifier and continuously update its classifier based on new input signals in near real-time. The proposed framework first removes EEC signal artifacts, then extracts a broad range of EEC signal features, and finally applies different online multitask learning (OMTL) algorithms to recognize individuals' stress in near real time. The proposed framework was applied on the EEC collected in two environments-first on the EEC collected in a controlled lab environment using a wired-EEC and second on the EEC collected at in the field using a wearable EEC device. The OMTL-VonNeuman method resulted in the best prediction accuracy on both datasets (71.14% on the first dataset and 77.61% on second) among all tested algorithms. The proposed stress recognition framework continuously updates its classifier and therefore contributes to stress recognition for new stressful situations that are beyond the range of predefined stressful conditions in near real time both in a controlled lab environment and at real job sites.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2870963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467324","Electroencephalogram (EEG);stress;online multi-task learning (OMTL);real-time stress recognition","Stress;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Classification algorithms;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring;Pattern recognition","Adult;Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Occupational Stress;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stress, Psychological","60","","91","IEEE","18 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aimed to reduce the subjective bias in form of human stress reactivity, by employing clustering methods to pre-label stress levels according to the inherent homogeneity and, perform SVM to classify the stress level. Brainwave signals at the prefrontal cortex (Fp1 and Fp2) from 50 participants were captured related to the stress induced by the virtual reality (VR) horror video and intelligence quotient (IQ) test. The power spectral density (PSD) values of Theta, Alpha, and Beta frequency bands were extracted, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were reported to show a significant difference in the absolute power between resting baseline and post-stimuli. The extracted features were further clustered into three groups of stress level. The labelled data based on k-means clustering method were fed into SVM to classify the stress levels. The performance of SVM classifier was validated by 10-fold cross validation method and the result affirmed the highest performance of 98% accuracy by using only the feature of Beta-band absolute power at right (Fp2) prefrontal region on account of the significant changes of Beta activity during pre- and post-stimuli. In essence, stress pattern has been found in the brain activity of Beta frequency band within right prefrontal cortex which has been shown to be significantly more active under stimuli. The hybrid approach of classification using k-means clustering and SVM has been proven to be an effective method in lieu of pre-labelling the stress level to reduce individual differences in stress response, and in turn to improve the reliability and detection rate of mental stress.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3148380","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia(grant numbers:Q.K130000.3856.18J91); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701348","Beta;electroencephalography (EEG);k-means clustering;power spectral density (PSD);stress;support vector machine (SVM)","Stress;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Task analysis;Stress measurement;Feature extraction;Clustering methods","","23","","62","CCBY","1 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has a significant part to play in priming motoric actions which depends on the actor's spontaneous neurological behaviour. Action Observation (AO) and Motor Imagery (MI) also lead to the stimulation of motor system. In fact, AO and MI result in activation of overlapping brain areas as the actual motor task. AO combined with MI (referred to as AO+MI) initiates higher cortical activity in comparison with either MI or AO alone. In this paper, we investigate the influence of affordance driven motor priming during AO, MI and AO + MI. Source current density as an EEG parameter is estimated by Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Our results demonstrate that affordance driven motor priming during AO+MI indicates stronger electrophysiological and behavioural changes. This is evident from the N2 ERP component. Further, the current source density (in brain regions associated with motor planning) during affordance driven AO+MI is found to be maximum.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871587","","Location awareness;Visualization;Affordances;Tomography;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Planning","Brain;Cardiac Electrophysiology;Imagery, Psychotherapy;Motor Activity;Referral and Consultation","","","24","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objective of this study is to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) complexity of 88 SAD subjects, subdivided into 4 balanced groups (22 severe, 22 moderate, 22 mild, and 22 healthy controls (HCs) using Fuzzy Entropy measure (FE) and machine learning algorithms. In addition, this study aimed at designing a computer-aided diagnosis system to identify the severity of SAD (severe, moderate, mild, and HC) in different EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). The experimental results showed that among the HC and the three considered levels of SAD, SAD patients in fast-waves exhibited significantly less FE values in resting-state compared with HCs (p  $\leq0.05$ ). The EEG complexity analysis showed a discriminatory neuronal activity over the frontoparietal and occipital regions between SAD patients and HCs. Additionally, the FE values measured in the resting-state were positively correlated with Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) scores in fast-waves (beta and alpha), indicating that the regional FE measures are putative biomarkers in assessing the clinical symptoms of SAD. Also, the classification results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the state of the art methods with an accuracy of 86.93 %, sensitivity of 92.46%, and specificity of 95.32% with the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier.

Stress is associated with the brain activities of human beings that can be scanned by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals which is very complex and often challenging to understand the signal’s pattern. This paper presented a system to detect the stress level from the EEG signals using machine learning algorithms. The proposed method, at first, removed physiological noises from the EEG signal applying a band-pass FIR filter. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method was used for features extraction from the filtered EEG signal. The features were classified using a set of classifiers those are k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

We focus on categorizing stress levels into four distinct categories: no stress, low stress, medium stress, and high stress. For analysis, we employ two advanced deep learning models, EEGNet and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which have demonstrated significant potential in managing the complexities of EEG data and identifying intricate patterns related to different stress levels.The methodology in this study includes rigorous data preprocessing, segmentation, and labeling to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the model training process. The EEG data from the 10 students are combined into a single dataset, with 70% allocated for training and 30% for testing. This approach ensures a robust evaluation of the models' predictive capabilities. We systematically compare EEGNet and CNN based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

After feature extraction and selection, we achieved a classification accuracy of 86,90% in the APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers comparison (regardless of diagnosis) and 85,71% in the AD patients versus healthy controls comparison (regardless of APOE ε4 status). When combining the results of all participants we reached a global accuracy of 73,81% in the four-class classification (AD patients carriers and non-carriers, healthy elderly carriers and non-carriers). We hope our work could help clinicians to make a more accurate and earlier AD diagnosis, considering the presence of the APOE ε4 allele.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782085","Alzheimer’s Disease;Apolipoprotein E;Event-Related Potentials;Event-Related Spectral Perturbation;Machine Learning;Feature Selection;Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Protocols;Perturbation methods;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Alzheimer's disease;Older adults;Engineering in medicine and biology","Humans;Alzheimer Disease;Apolipoprotein E4;Male;Female;Aged;Alleles;Evoked Potentials;Electroencephalography;Heterozygote;Case-Control Studies;Support Vector Machine","","","42","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objective of this work is to confirm whether individuals with SAD contribute to the finding of spectral power between theta and beta ratio (THBR) activity. The second objective is to compare the individual differences between resting-state brain oscillations and recovery from social performing task for SAD and healthy control (HC) groups. From 10 healthy participants (5 SAD and 5 HC), resting-state EEG during (eyes open, eyes closed) and during recovery from social performing task (self-presentation) was recorded. Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) for SAD was administered to determine the severity level of social anxiety in all participants. As a result, findings reported here suggests that increased THBR and FMT may reflect a reduced frontal cortical activity over subcortical oscillations. In accordance with several findings, THBR was found to correlate negatively with the self-reported score of SIAS in SAD group but correlate positively with HC group. As we hypothesized, SAD individuals showed less FMT comparing to the HC group which indicates that FMT is a neurophysiological correlate on anxiety state more than anxiety trait. These results are steady with previous studies and support the concept that slow wave/ fast wave and FMT may provide a useful tool in the study of affect and the neural mechanism of emotion regulation. Together, our findings interpreted to suggest that THBR and FMT are possible neurobiological markers for SAD and can differentiate between state and trait SAD during resting state and social stressors.","","978-1-7281-7243-9","10.1109/ICCSCE50387.2020.9204923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9204923","Theta/beta ratio;cross-frequency coupling;neurofeedback;neurophysiological biomarkers;spectral power density;functional connectivity","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Correlation;Imaging;Biomarkers;Rhythm;Electrodes","","8","","31","IEEE","24 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel deep learning model is designed to precisely screen electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to characterise the neural patterns associated with anxiety. Our deep learning model integrates a convolutional neural network, an attention module and a recurrent neural network to effectively estimate the EEG features signifying normal and anxious emotions. In order to improve the performance of the model, we adopted a data transformation approach to generate a spatio-temporal representation of EEG data. We evaluated the performance of our proposed model using a publicly available EEG data set acquired from 23 subjects who reported feeling normal or anxious. Anxiety was further categorised into four sub-groups based on the level of anxiety. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.24% and 92.58% for binary (i.e normal and anxious) and multi-class (i.e normal, light, moderate and severe anxiety) scenarios, respectively. The obtained results indicated the success of our proposed model in learning EEG patterns across various levels of anxiety.

For synthesizing subject-specific EEG signals, a conditional deep convolutional GAN is used. Apart from measuring the usual signal similarity, we also computed the correlation between the subject-wise event-related potentials (ERPs) corresponding to the real and synthetic EEG data. The characterization of the ERPs highlights that the GAN is not only able to learn the distribution of real EEG signals but also can preserve their temporal characteristics. Further, EEG biometrics experiments are also performed to verify the effectiveness of the synthesized EEG signals in data augmentation.

In this study, we investigate the influence of time limitation in exam on the performance of students and use EEG to explore the contribution of stress towards the change in performance. For this purpose, students performed mental arithmetic task (MAT) based on Montreal Imaging Stress Task of same difficulty level twice; once with time limitation accompanied by feedback for every question to induce stress and once without any time limitation and feedback. We observe vast difference in performance of the students for the two MAT tests and significant change in the power spectral density of theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands associated with increase in stress level for three chosen electrodes in EEG results.

This paper investigates the feasibility of detecting different stress levels using electroencephalography (EEG), and evaluates the effectiveness of various stress-relief methods. EEG data were collected from 25 subjects while they were at rest and under 3 different levels of stress induced by mental arithmetic tasks. Nine features that correlate with stress from existing literature were extracted. Subsequently, discriminative features were selected by Fisher Ratio and used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier. Results from 10-fold cross-validation yielded averaged intra-subject classification accuracy of 85.6% for stress versus rest, 7l.2% for two levels of stress and rest, and 58.4% for three levels of stress and rest. The results showed high promise of using EEG to detect level of stress, and the features selected showed that Beta brain waves (13-30HZ) and prefrontal relative Gamma power are most discriminative. Five different stress-relief methods were then evaluated, and the method of hugging a pillow was found to be the most effective measure relatively in decreasing the stress level detected using EEG. These results show promise of future research in real-time stress detection and reduction using EEG for stress management and relief.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175900","","Stress;Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Data models;Music","Brain Waves;Discriminant Analysis;Electroencephalography;Humans;Mathematics;Stress, Psychological","11","","25","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this research is to reduce these MR-induced artifacts in order to extract useful information from the EEG recordings, specifically auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). The BA was reduced through the use of an algorithm which creates an adaptive BA template by median-filtering the previous 10 artifacts in the EEG signal. The continuously updated template is then subtracted from each BA in the EEG signal. Results are reported for five subjects, and it was found that the results for the mismatch negativities (MMNs) were comparable to those that have previously been reported for studies using auditory frequency deviants.

The study examines both time and frequency domain features to evaluate the effectiveness of varying window lengths. Additionally, a genetic feature selection algorithm is applied to balance the anxiety classification performance and model complexity. The comparative analysis of sliding window lengths reveals that shorter window sizes can enhance anxiety classification performance. Moreover, utilizing the feature selection algorithm improves classification performance by 2.16% and 2.54%, respectively, for the best-performing Gradient Boosting and XGBoost classifiers with a 1-second window size.

As a consequence, the estimated components must be further investigated to assess the existence of reciprocal similarities. In this work a method for finding residual dependency subsets of component is proposed. Firstly a hierarchical clustering stage is carried out to classify ICA results. Then the hierarchical tree is investigated at each level by two indices to evaluate the tightness of all clusters.

The game involves controlling a vehicle to dodge obstacles, with the number of obstacles increasing based on complexity.

The standard pipeline foresees the individuation of relevant components, and the computation of discrete features characterizing them, as latency and amplitude. Nonetheless, this approach only evaluates one aspect of the signal at a time, without considering its overall morphology; consequently being highly susceptible to low signal to noise ratio. In this context, we resort to Functional Data Analysis: a statistical methodology designed for the examination of curves and functions. Treating functions as statistical units enables the extraction of features that encompass the complete signal morphology. Functional Principal Component Analysis addresses whole ERPs as statistical units, allowing for the extraction of interpretable and comprehensive features. Exploiting this method, we compute three functional features from ERPs registered during an image categorization task. To validate our approach, firstly we examine the correlation between functional and discrete features to address the amount of overlapping information, and we consider the consistency of the obtained insights with previous literature. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of our method by evaluating the classification performance achieved when using our extracted features to identify the object observed during the ERP recording. Such performance is compared to state-of-the-art feature extraction methods, using multiple metrics, classification algorithms, and datasets. The functional features consistently perform better, or analogously, across metrics, algorithms, and datasets they also embed additional information and provide insights coherent with previous literature, proving the usefulness of Functional Data Analysis in the context of ERP studies.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3522485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815998","Signal processing;visual event related potentials;EEG;functional data analysis","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Standards;Visualization;Principal component analysis;Recording;Pipelines;Electrodes;Image categorization;Signal to noise ratio","Humans;Evoked Potentials;Electroencephalography;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Principal Component Analysis;Brain;Algorithms;Male;Adult;Female;Young Adult","","","39","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Anodal tDCS over the left PFC has been shown to improve levels of awareness in minimally conscious state patients (MCS) patients. MCS patients may display short transient episodes of reactivity to specific verbal stimuli versus other totally unresponsive awake DOC subgroups that seem to be in a vegetative state (VS). Patients EEG were collected via two main EEG systems, the Neurosteer® system, a mobile 3-electrode neurological BCI allowing cloud-based online analysis of the classical EEG bands, along with novel machine-learning based biomarkers, and a standard clinical EEG/ERP 19 channel wired-system, that includes an offline integrated-software to execute Time-frequency analyses and ERP analyses of different brain states (qEEG) and evaluate evoked sensory/cognitive processing potential-components captured in event-related potentials (ERP's) reflecting early auditory information processing. Clinical recovery scores, noting reactivity to stimuli and levels of awareness were noted at baseline (paired with mobile 3-channel Neurosteer-system biomarker activity recording) and after the tDCS intervention, as well as during the one-year post-stimulation period. Preliminary results indicate changes in clinical recovery scores, auditory ERP's indicating increased sensitivity to echoic memory neural-excitability, and in the EEG-based biomarkers in a subset of patients (three patients). One patient that showed the most pronounced clinical improvement following tDCS treatment indicated significant change in his auditory ERP's, VC9 biomarker and frontal theta activity, while the other patients that showed significant changes in their event-related brain activity did not reveal changes in their clinical recovery scores. These findings may imply higher sensitivity of pre-attentive auditory ERPs and EEG-based machine-learning event-related parameters versus the standard clinical testing scores used to detect DOC patients’ condition in the clinical setting. Importantly, unlike the standard clinical EEG systems that acquire ERP's, the Neurosteer® system can be applied during routine examinations of CRS-R scores at bedside, without additional experimental sessions, can be viewed online, without trained personnel, and avoiding time-consuming EEG application or offline EEG analyses.","2572-7672","978-1-6654-1337-4","10.1109/BCI53720.2022.9734839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734839","EEG;BCI;Mismatch negativity (MMN);minimal conscious state (MCS);tDCS treatment;machine learning biomarkers;prefrontal cortex","Time-frequency analysis;Sensitivity;Machine learning;Biomarkers;Electroencephalography;Personnel;Transient analysis","","","","9","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the experiments, the participants were required to wear an EEG that measures brain activity reflecting the emotional states of seafarers while operating using the ship bridge simulator. At the same time, the trajectories of vessel movement were recorded accordingly. Next, a bipolar dimensional emotion model consisting of valence (from displeasure to pleasure) and arousal (from relaxation to excitement) dimensions, was generated to identify seafarers' emotional states. Integrated with vessel trajectory data (such as rudder angle, ship speed, etc.), the correlation analysis was conducted to explore the patterns of seafarers' emotion during collision avoidance operations.

Whereas many neuroimaging methods have been proposed to solely identify mental stress. The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could increase the rate at which mental stress is detected and properly measure stress levels. We use EEG features using the SVM algorithm to improve accuracy and deliver accurate stress levels, which will aid in illness prevention. While traditional self-report measures of stress can be subjective and prone to bias, EEG-based detection of mental stress offers an objective and non-invasive method for quantifying stress levels. In this study, we develop and evaluate a machine learning-based system for the detection of mental stress using EEG signals. We collected EEG data from a group of participants while they performed cognitive tasks designed to induce mental stress.

The adversarial inference is introduced to automatically capture invariant and discriminative features from raw EEG, which aims to improve the classification accuracy and generalization ability across subjects. Experiments were conducted with 22 human subjects, where each participant’s stress was induced by the Trier Social Stress Test paradigm while EEG was collected. Stress states were then calibrated into four or five stages according to the changing trend of salivary cortisol concentration.

Stress is a defensive mechanism that follows multiple stages of physiological responses, culminating in adaptation or coping of the body. However, frequent occurrence of stress can lead to fatal mental and physical consequences. Hence incessant stress monitoring in subjects, even during routine tasks, is vital. More critical is the identification of stress during its early onset, when the physiological response is at its peak. Quantifying stress using EEG based technology has been prevalent for the past several decades. But due to its lack of portability and the comparatively early stages of single channel acquisition devices, use of EEG based devices for continuous remote stress monitoring is quite impractical. The most suitable alternative is human stress analysis through non- EEG physiological signals acquired using wearable devices like smart watches and electronic finger rings. This paper investigates continuous stress monitoring using features from non-EEG signals such as acceleration (movement, gravity, noise), temperature, electrodermal activity, arterial oxygen level, and heart rate. Data from 20 healthy subj ects was collected during Relaxation, Physical stress, Cognitive stress, and Emotional stress states. Sample epochs were temporally segmented into windows representing the onset, sustenance, and offset of stress. Eighty-one linear and non-linear measures were extracted from each windowed epoch. Stress state identification was performed using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, with performance evaluated via stratified 5-fold cross- validation. Findings indicate stress impacts are greatest at onset, with L-minute and 2-minute windows yielding higher classification accuracies than 5-minute windows. Optimizing temporal segmentation can reduce stress identification time by 60%.","","979-8-3503-8969-2","10.1109/IICAIET62352.2024.10730226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10730226","Stress monitoring;Multi-modal;Windowed epochs;Feature extraction;Linear classification;Non-linear classification;non-EEG data;Wearable devices","Temperature measurement;Accuracy;Anxiety disorders;Human factors;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Biomedical monitoring;Stress;Monitoring","","","","27","IEEE","30 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an experimental study to ascertain the appropriate phase, when electroencephalography (EEG) based data should be recorded for classification of perceived mental stress. The process involves data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification. The stress level of each subject is recorded by using a standard perceived stress scale questionnaire, which is then used to label the EEG data. The data are divided into two (stressed and non-stressed) and three (non-stressed, mildly stressed, and stressed) classes. The EEG data of 28 participants are recorded using a commercially available four channel Muse EEG headband in two phases i.e., pre-activity and post-activity. Five feature groups, which include power spectral density, correlation, differential asymmetry, rational asymmetry, and power spectrum are extracted from five bands of each EEG channel. We propose a new feature selection algorithm, which selects features from appropriate EEG frequency band based on classification accuracy. Three classifiers i.e., support vector machine, the Naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron are used to classify stress level of the participants. It is evident from our results that EEG recording during the pre-activity phase is better for classifying the perceived stress. An accuracy of $\text{92.85}\%$ and $\text{64.28}\%$ is achieved for two- and three-class stress classification, respectively, while utilizing five groups of features from theta band.

Stress is harmful to humans and can cause various physical and mental illnesses, such as headaches, anxiety, depression, and heart diseases. The aim of this study is to design a machine learning-based model to measure the mental stress level of a person using electroencephalography (EEG) signals of the frontal lobe. The proposed stress level assessment technique can classify the stress level of a person into four categories: no stress, low stress, moderate stress, and high stress. In our study, first EEG signals of the subjects have been recorded while they solve four mathematical question sets with different complexity levels. Subsequently, different handcrafted feature extraction techniques have been employed for extracting eight features, namely Skewness, Kurtosis, Maximum, Mean, Mean Absolute Value, Minimum, Standard Deviation, and Power Spectral Density from the pre-processed EEG signals. A majority voting-based ensemble classifier model has been designed by combining the predictions of three different classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest neighbour (KNN), and Naive Bayes, to predict a person's mental stress level.

It aims to represent stress states musically by use of stress-induced EEG features known to be highly correlated to stress, and also attempts to intuitively show whether stress is relieved by scent therapy through changes in musical expression of brain signals. The theta/alpha enhancement protocol is utilized to generate music from stress-evoked EEG features. Four subjects (19~24 age, all right-handed) participated in the experiment. Their stress levels measured by the cognitive stress scale-14(PSS-14) before and after the experiment. While measuring their EEG data in stress or non-stress condition, music is generated in line with their stress states. The results showed that music changed from slow tempo and calm mood toward faster and louder, while the brain state transits from normal to stress by stimulation inducing stress and subject becomes deeper in stress. During aromatherapy in stress condition, there was no noticeable change in music as compared with stress condition. Nevertheless, all participants show lower stress scores after aromatherapy and two subjects has gained higher theta/alpha ratio during aromatherapy. This is because aromatherapy for stress alleviation is considered to be highly inter-subjective variable or some specific subjects are still exposed to stress in spite of sufficient scent to them. Thus, we expect that sometime after stress condition, aromatherapy could mitigate stress and music could be returned to normal state.","2572-7672","978-1-7281-8485-2","10.1109/BCI51272.2021.9385354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385354","Stress;Brainwave;Music;Aromatherapy","COVID-19;Atmospheric measurements;Music;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Stress;Stress measurement","","1","","16","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No. 476),"6 Aug 2002","2000","","","134","141","Established techniques for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) involve averaging time-locked sections of the EEG signal over many trials to obtain the ERP waveform. Such techniques are necessary as single-trial ERP signals are generally obscured by ongoing EEG activity, with signal-to-noise ratios below -10 dB. The averaging process does not preserve changes in the ERP signal from trial to trial. As these may provide clinically useful information, several methods have been developed to enable the extraction of single-trial ERPs. A quantitative method was developed for testing the accuracy of single-trial ERP estimates. ERP signals were simulated by using a piecewise model of an ERP known as the contingent negative variation (CNV). By randomly varying parameters of the model, a large number of unique ERPs were generated. Each of these was embedded in simulated EEG noise modelled as an autoregressive (AR) process driven by white noise. The known simulated ERPs were compared to the corresponding estimates produced by single-trial ERP extraction techniques in terms of the amount of distortion introduced. The above method was used to test a number of single-trial ERP extraction techniques. These were time-sequence adaptive filtering, singularity detection using wavelets, adaptive multi-resolution analysis, and a modification of the multi-resolution analysis technique. None of the methods extracted sufficiently accurate waveforms from single-trial ERPs contaminated with realistic EEG noise. Improved, but still unsatisfactory, ERP estimates were obtained when the AR EEG noise was replaced by Gaussian noise.","0537-9989","0-85296-728-4","10.1049/cp:20000329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=889963","","","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, this technique has some caveats: the ERPs have to be strictly time-locked with similar shape, i.e. emitted with the same latency and the same profile, with minor fluctuations of their amplitudes. Also, the method requires a huge number of valid trials (~100) to efficiently raise the ERPs from the EEG trials. In the case of cognitive ERPs, as with the N400, the delivered stimulus has to be different for each trial, the latencies are varying, and the number of available trials is usually low. In this paper, an alternative method, coined Integral Shape Averaging (ISA) and its derivatives are detailed. ISA is robust to varying latencies and affine transforms of shape. Furthermore, a new method coined ISAD can be derived to extract ERPs even from a single trial experiment. The aim here is to illustrate the potential of ISAD for N400 component extraction on real EEG data, with emphasis on its general applicability for ERPs computation and its major assets like reduced experimental protocol. Some insights are also given on its potential use to study ERP variability, through shape and latency.Clinical Relevance— The proposed algorithm aims to be a helpful tool in clinical practice to analyze and interpret evoked responses in real experimental settings, especially for particularities in neurology.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630271","","Neurology;Protocols;Fluctuations;Shape;Estimation;Transforms;Tools","Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Humans;Male","1","","19","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subjects tried to counteract anxious and stressful states through NF, that is by decreasing the power in the beta band measured in the midline areas of the scalp. The assessment of the neurofeedback effectiveness was based on the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in combination with EEG. Therefore, EEG signal was exploited in real-time to guide the feedback and also in post processing, together with the HRV, to assess the effectiveness of the whole training. As the EEG signal is concerned, the results showed that the power in the beta band decreased within each session when the ER ability was strengthened, as reported in the literature. On the contrary, the HRV did not exhibit the expected increasing trend within each trial. When considering each the session on the whole, thus computing the HRV on a greater time interval, the HRV during the NF training is typically higher than the HRV computed during the rest and negative baseline phases.","","979-8-3503-0080-2","10.1109/MetroXRAINE58569.2023.10405699","Italian Ministry for Universities and Research(grant numbers:FIT4MEDROB,PNC0000007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10405699","Neurofeedkack;EEG;HRV;emotion regulation;surgery","Training;Scalp;Electroencephalography;Regulation;Neurosurgery;Noise measurement;Heart rate variability","","","","32","IEEE","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a supervised signal-to-noise ratio maximizer (SSM)method to obtain N400 waveform from multi-channel EEG data is proposed. The SSM algorithm designs a spatial filter for low-rank ERP component and extracts the N400 by 40-trial EEG datasets of each subject. The algorithm has more excellent performance in estimating the accurate N400 waveform from simulation data and real EEG data, compared to SIM and the regularized SOBI algorithms.

Stress mindsets can be altered through education. This paper measures whether or not e-healthcare-based education can help students change their stress mindset from debilitating to enhancing. Further, it analyzes changes in electroencephalography (EEG) response when students with an enhanced mindset are stressed. Through health care education, people can acquire a stress enhancing mindset. If an individual has such a mindset, their EEG will show that they are more responsive in stress situations.

This difference is measured at the level of neural activity, as Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most distinctive tools used to measure neural activity in the brain. Experts use EEG to diagnose disorders through recorded brain activity, including seizures, but the diagnosis process consumes much time and effort.

The first syllable of the non-words being fixed, ERPs were triggered from the onset of the middle syllable, which was established by manually segmenting the non-words at phoneme level. The ERP responses elicited by the second syllable were examined. Nonparametric t-tests were carried out to compare the different ERP responses of the middle syllable. The results show that different ERPs were produced by consonants belonging to different phonemic categories (fricatives, plosives, liquids, nasals and affricates). ERP amplitudes and their scalp distribution differed from each other across non-similar phonetic categories. Consonants from the same phonemic category elicited similar ERP responses. Further, the scalp distributions of the ERP responses were characteristically different for different phoneme classes of consonants. These results suggest that the manner of articulation is an important component of the phonetic representation of consonants in the brain.","","978-1-5386-1264-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268226","auditory events;speech transients;speech segmentation;auditory feature extraction;EEG;auditory event-related potentials (ERP)","Speech;Electroencephalography;Scalp;Electrodes;Liquids;Electric potential;Band-pass filters","","6","","18","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the study of a non-invasive system that measures mental stress using EEG signals that are acquired from one channel. The process involves EEG data acquisition, feature extraction, and stress level classification through machine learning. Moreover, this system was tested on human subjects. In addition, a questionnaire developed by psychologists that covered a wide range of symptoms associated with stress was utilized. The questionnaire is referred to as the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Thus, the EEG signals of twenty participants were recorded through single-channel EEG for five minutes. Feature extraction based on the frequency bands is used to train the machine learning algorithm to classify two stress levels: stressed and not stressed. Lastly, the increased beta activity of the subjects with high stress was observed with subjects without stress.

Stress can also lead to psychological and behavioral disorders. Heart rate variability (HRV) can reflect changes in stress levels while other physiological factors, like blood pressure, are within acceptable ranges. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a vital technique for studying brain activities and provides useful data regarding changes in mental status. This study incorporates EEG and a detailed HRV analysis to have a better understanding and analysis of stress. Investigating the correlation between EEG and HRV under stress conditions is valuable since they provide complementary information regarding stress. Methods: Simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) and EEG recordings were obtained from fifteen subjects. HRV /EEG features were analyzed and compared in rest, stress, and meditation conditions. A one-way ANOVA and correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis to explore the correlation between HRV features and features extracted from EEG. Results: The HRV features LF (low frequency), HF (high frequency), LF/HF, and rMSSD (root mean square of the successive differences) correlated with EEG features, including alpha power band in the left hemisphere and alpha band power asymmetry. Conclusion: This study demonstrated five significant relationships between EEG and HRV features associated with stress. The ability to use stress-related EEG features in combination with correlated HRV features could help improve detecting stress and monitoring the progress of stress treatments/therapies. The outcomes of this study could enhance the efficiency of stress management technologies such as meditation studies and bio-feedback training.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2021.3106803","King Abdul-Aziz University (KAU) Doctoral Scholarship Academic for the Ph.D. Program at Florida Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520410","Stress;EEG;ECG;HRV;meditation","Stress;Electroencephalography;Heart rate variability;Electrodes;Heart rate;Feature extraction;Electrocardiography","Brain;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Heart Rate;Humans;Stroke","49","","40","CCBYNCND","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an effort to make ERP components more specific to distinct underlying neural substrates, recorded EEG signals were firstly dissolved into multiple independent components (ICs) using independent component analysis (ICA). Thereafter, individual ICs with prominent sensory- or cognitive-related ERP components were selected to separately reconstruct scalp EEG signals at representative channels, from which ERP waveforms were built, respectively. Statistical comparisons on amplitudes of stimulus-locked ERP components, i.e., prefrontal P2 and N2, parietal P3, bilateral occipital P1 and N1, revealed significant reduced P3 amplitude in error trials than in correct trials. In addition, significant evident ERN was also observed in error trials but not in correct trials. Considering the temporal locus of semantic conflict in the present task, we concluded that reduced P3 amplitude in error trials reflect impaired resolving process of semantic conflict, which further lead to a performance error in the Stroop color-word matching task.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945050","","Electroencephalography;Integrated circuits;Semantics;Scalp;Image color analysis;Accuracy;Educational institutions","Adult;Algorithms;Behavior;Brain;Color;Evoked Potentials;Female;Humans;Language;Male;Stroop Test;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","","","21","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often these factors result in long-term issues with daytime sleepiness, emotional instability, and mental exhaustion, which may lead to difficulties in the educational process. This study introduces the Daily Sampling System (DSS) implemented as a smartphone application, which combines a set of self-assessment scales for evaluating variations in the emotional state and sleep quality throughout a full academic term. In addition to submitting the daily sampling scores, the participants regularly filled in the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS) reports and took part in resting-state EEG data recording immediately after report completion. In total, this study collected 1835 daily samples and 94 combined DASS with EEG datasets from 18 university students (aged 23–27 years), with 79.3± 15.3% response ratio in submitting the daily reports during an academic semester. The results of pairwise testing and multiple regression analysis demonstrate that the daily level of self-perceived fatigue correlates positively with stress, daytime sleepiness, and negatively with alertness on awakening, self-evaluated sleep quality, and sleep duration. The spectral analysis of the EEG data reveals a significant increase in the resting-state spectral power density across the theta and low-alpha frequency bands associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress. Additionally, the state of depression was accompanied by an intensification of high-frequency EEG activity over the temporal regions. No significant differences in prefrontal alpha power asymmetry were observed under the described experimental conditions while comparing the states of calmness and emotional arousal of the participants for the three conditions of depression, anxiety, and stress.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2972812","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-10-2-0022); Center For Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS2B) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 108-2221-E-009-045-MY3,MOST 108-2321-B-010-014-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8990113","Students;stress;fatigue;anxiety;depression;sleep;electroencephalography","Sleep;Stress;Fatigue;Electroencephalography;Depression;Drugs;Atmospheric measurements","Electroencephalography;Emotions;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Sleep;Students","18","","70","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we propose a novel SincNet-based neural network for detecting emotions in ASD patients using EEG signals. The learned filters can be easily inspected to detect which part of the EEG spectrum is used for predicting emotions. We found that our system automatically learns the high-α (9-13 Hz) and β (13-30 Hz) band suppression often present in individuals with ASD. This result is consistent with recent neuroscience studies on emotion recognition, which found an association between these band suppressions and the behavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD.

In this work, machine learning-based automatic recognition of mental stress during math puzzle solving is developed using EEG signals. EEG signals are recorded using Enobio 8 device in two categories, one during math puzzle solving and another in happy state with audio-visual stimuli with funny video clips. The raw signals are preprocessed to remove the artifacts using 2-40Hz band pass filter. Filtered data is used to extract EEG bands. EEG relative band power is analyzed to observe the changes during math task and relaxation. The two mental states are classified using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The classification accuracy of 86% is achieved in beta band.","","979-8-3503-1398-7","10.1109/ICSCNA58489.2023.10370715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10370715","Electroencephalogram;Brain Computer Interface;Deep learning;Mental Arithmetic;Long Short Term Memory;Stress","Band-pass filters;Deep learning;Electric potential;Human factors;Electroencephalography;Mathematical models;Data mining","","1","","12","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Healthy young and elderly volunteers passively viewed the stimuli which were divided into pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. The study shows differential processing of emotional stimuli in comparison to the neutral in terms of temporal resolution (latency) and activation of neuronal assembles (amplitude).

The device triggered the auricular vagus nerve branch through the tragus for 15 minutes, with prefrontal EEG data collected pre and post aVNS (each for 5 minutes) to capture stress indicators. Given that the frontal location is prone to noise, EEG signal pre-processing through independent component analysis (ICA) was used to reduce eye movements and other artifacts. Alpha (8-14 Hz) asymmetry in prefrontal location in both hemispheres was computed from locations Fp1 and Fp2 for one second segments of EEG; these asymmetry values were normalised by subtracting the post aVNS (or placebo) from pre aVNS (placebo). The normalised alpha frontal asymmetries were assessed for statistical significance using T-test. Results showed increased aVNS alpha prefrontal asymmetry compared to placebo, indicating reduced stress. This was statistically significant ( ) for all five subjects.

Nevertheless, raw EEG signals were prone to noise contamination, such as electromyography artifacts from muscle movements and electrooculography artifacts from eye blinking, which could adversely impact signal analysis. To overcome this challenge, we employed pre-processing techniques involving fourth-order Butterworth filters and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reject and reduce noise from the EEG data. The EEG signals were recorded while participants performed a go/no-go association task (GNAT), allowing us to gain insights into the cognitive responses and neural activity patterns related to drug exposure in the teenage population. The combination of EEG signal recording with the GNAT task provided a powerful and informative approach to understanding the cognitive implications of drug exposure in teenagers.

Extracting ERPs from a limited number of trials remains challenging due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution caused by volume conduction. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for trial-by-trial concatenated EEG, in which the concatenated ERPs are expressed as a linear combination of a set of discrete sine and cosine bases. The bases are simply determined by the data length of a single trial. A sparse prior on the rank of the spatio-spectral pattern matrix is introduced into the model to allow the number of components to be automatically determined. A maximum posterior estimation algorithm based on cyclic descent is then developed to estimate the spatiospectral patterns. A spatial filter can then be obtained by maximizing the SNR of the ERP components. Experiments on both synthetic data and real N170 ERP from 13 subjects were conducted to test the efficacy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can estimate the ERPs more accurately than the several state-of-the-art algorithms.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2496284","Chinese 863 Project(grant numbers:2012AA011601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61403144,61431007,91220301,91320202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7747470","Convex optimization;event-related potential(ERP);N170;nuclear norm;regularization;sparse learning","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Signal to noise ratio;Probabilistic logic;Algorithm design and analysis;Sparse matrices;Face","","13","","34","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early detection of MCI can slow disease progression and ease the burden on patients and caregivers. This study aimed to explore sensory-perception deficits and fluctuations in MCI using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) from a prefrontal two-channel EEG device. The study involved 573 MCI patients and 1,295 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, with cognitive decline assessed through the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study analyzed ERPs and trial-to-trial variability using the response variance curve (RVC) in neural responses to eight auditory sounds. While no significant differences were observed in ERP amplitudes and area under the curves (AUCs) for sensory (N1) and perception (P2) processing between MCI and CN groups, MCI patients showed notable differences in trial-to-trial variability, particularly in those aged 70 to 79 years. This variability remained significant even after adjusting for factors like age, sex, years of education, and MMSE scores. The study suggests that MCI is associated with instability in pre-attentive auditory detection and higher-order perceptual processing. The findings highlight that people in their 70s may be in a transitional phase associating these sensory-perceptual variabilities with cognitive impairment. Given the large sample size and limitations of current neuropsychological tests, the study underscores the potential of sensory ERP measures as a supplementary tool for MCI screening.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2025.3541729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10884705","Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI);Event Related Potentials (ERP);Trial-to-Trial variability;Alzheimer’s Disease (AD);Sensory Processing;Electroencephalogram (EEG);Dementia;Response variance curve (RVC)","Electroencephalography;Batteries;Fluctuations;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Alzheimer's disease;Standards;Recording;Performance evaluation;Education","","","","","CCBY","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Another technique that is very useful and common, i.e., EEG, is mostly used to do such data analysis. EEG plays a very important role in detecting and correcting brain illness. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using small metal electrodes attached to the scalp. This activity results in wave lines of EEG signals. Here, we used a combination of the K-means algorithm and SVM-supervised machine learning algorithm to analyze the EEG data. K-means algorithm is used to divide and attempt to cluster the data while the SVM algorithm is used to classify the stress level based on these clusters. The main objective of this model is to improve the accuracy of stress detection by using the strength of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

PTSD is a mental disorder with a set of symptoms observed in a person following exposure to a life-threatening event or witness a death. The primary characteristic of PTSD is the persistence over time of certain symptoms: flashbacks, traumatic nightmares, acute stress, and symptoms of depression. In a stressful situation, the whole body goes into tension. This has an energy cost and affects the voice, breathing, daily gestures, and face, which are referred to in this survey article as external symptoms. The diagnosis of PTSD is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification using standard questionnaires where the patient self-reports their condition based on their symptoms. Indeed, these questionnaires have several limitations and give an imprecise diagnosis. Sensors and wearable-based technologies can play a key role in improving the diagnosis, the prognosis, and the assistance of PTSD. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed for PTSD detection based on external symptoms and brain activity using video and electroencephalography (EEG) sensors.

Firstly, Asian athletes have to complete revised competitive state anxiety inventory-2 (CSAI-2R) questionnaires. The Asian athletes then were recorded for their QEEG twice in 2 weeks (1 time/week) before competing in a match. In the competition, the anxiety symptom and performance of Asian athletes are observed and their feedbacks from the coach are asked. Lastly, the anxiety level is classified from results of QEEG maps, the CSAI-2R questionnaires and condition in the competition. The result of anxiety level showed that the quantity of alpha frequency band in posterior head region (parietal and occipital lobes) is less than the normal condition in term of brain topographic map. In addition, amateur Asian athletes have lower quantity of alpha frequency band than the experienced Asian athletes when the time of competition becomes nearer.

In this study, we proposed utilizing electroencephalography (EEG), alpha amylase and behavioral measures to assess the level of mental stress during a period of 240 days of isolation and confinement. We quantified the levels of mental stress using the reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, and the functional connectivity network of the brain's electrical beta EEG signals estimated by Phase Locking Values (PLV). Our results showed that, the alpha amylase level has increased by 62% from the beginning of the mission to the end of the 240-days mission. This indicates that isolation and confinement contributes to elevation of mental stress. The functional connectivity network showed a significant decrease in the information flow in the frontal regions across all subjects with statistical significance of $\mathbf{p} < \boldsymbol{0.05}$. Meanwhile, the behavioral data showed no differences from the beginning to the end of the 240-days mission, which could be due to the short data recording time of 10 minutes during each experiment time. The overall results suggested that the frontal beta EEG connectivity can be used as a potential biomarker for detecting elevated stress in isolation and confined environment.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123844","American University of Sharjah; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123844","Mental Stress;Isolation;Confinement;EEG;Alpha amylase","Space missions;Psychology;Neural engineering;Human factors;Object detection;Electroencephalography;Recording","","2","","19","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mental health can be a source of thinking as well as the response center of all activities. The pressures faced, the burden of thoughts, and food patterns can be a source of human psychological conditions. If the human psychological condition is under stress, it can cause disease. The development of intelligent system technology can take advantage of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to recognize human mental conditions (stressed and normal). The purpose of this research was to determine the most appropriate method in identifying human psychology (stress and normal) from EEG. Based on the EEG signal taken through the recording of the response signal of the human brain, feature extraction is performed. The features taken are the mean, standard deviation, and MAV (Mean Absolute Value) of each subband, and channel. The total data of respondents studied were 20 people, with 10 normal criteria, and 10 stress. Each of the mean, standard deviation, and MAV features was modeled using the Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Backpropagation, Regression Logistics, Deep Learning, ID3 methods.

It can severely impact quality of life, but also place a large burden on the health systems. Despite its omnipresence and impact on mental and physical health, most of the individuals suffering from anxiety do not receive appropriate treatment. Furthermore, while neuroimaging research consistently implicated subcortical structures such as amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in anxiety, there is still a lack of consensus on the underlying neurophysiological processes contributing to this condition. Thus, the objective neurophysiological markers for anxiety remain elusive. Methods allowing non-invasive recording and assessment of cortical processing provide an opportunity to help identify anxiety signatures that could be used as intervention targets. In this paper, we tackle this problem by applying a regression spatial filter called Source-Power Comodulation (SPoC) to trait anxiety data of 43 individuals. By maximizing the correlation of alpha band power and the level of trait anxiety in resting state electroencephalography (EEG) we are able to obtain neurophysiologically meaningful patterns that should be helpful in the search of biomarkers for mental disorders.","2372-9198","978-1-6654-4121-6","10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474744","Trait anxiety;EEG analysis;Alpha band;Correlation;Brain Patterns;Interpretability","Neuroimaging;Brain;Correlation;Mental disorders;Sociology;Biomarkers;Spatial filters","","","","13","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Near infrared probes were aligned with C3 and C4, and EEG electrodes were placed midway between the NIRS probes. NIRS and EEG signals were acquired from six healthy subjects during six imagined hand clenching force and speed tasks involving the right hand. The results showed that NIRS combined with EEG is effective for simultaneously measuring brain activity of the sensorimotor area. The study also showed that in the duration of (0, 10) s for imagined force and speed of hand clenching, HbO first exhibited a negative variation trend, which was followed by a negative peak. After the negative peak, it exhibited a positive variation trend with a positive peak about 6-8 s after termination of imagined movement. During (-2, 1) s, the EEG may have indicated neural processing during the preparation, execution, and monitoring of a given imagined force and speed of hand clenching. The instantaneous phase, frequency, and amplitude feature of the EEG were calculated by Hilbert transform; HbO and the difference between HbO and Hb concentrations were extracted. The features of NIRS and EEG were combined to classify three levels of imagined force [at 20/50/80% MVGF (maximum voluntary grip force)] and speed (at 0.5/1/2 Hz) of hand clenching by SVM. The average classification accuracy of the NIRS-EEG fusion feature was 0.74 ± 0.02.

They had to correct the deviation and their response time was considered as an indicator of attention level. Participants repeated the task in two sessions; in one session they received kinesthetic feedback and in another session no feedback. Using their EEG signals, we trained three attention classifiers; a support vector machine (SVM) using EEG spectral band powers, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using either spectral features or the raw EEG data. Our results indicated that the CNN model trained on raw EEG data obtained under kinesthetic feedback achieved the highest accuracy (89%). While using a participant’s own brain activity to train the model resulted in the best performances, inter-subject transfer learning still performed high (75%), showing promise for calibration-free Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems.

It is therefore important to analyze the security and privacy threats these devices may introduce to their users. In this paper, we explore how malicious access to brainwave signals may surreptitiously reveal users' privacy-sensitive medical conditions and personal information, while they are browsing the web (or interacting with an app). At a conceptual level, we investigate the potential of brainwave signals, captured during a user's normal interactions with visual stimuli (e.g., images and audio-visuals) through a website or computer, in exposing whether the user is suffering from a given medical disorder (e.g., drug abuse or autism) and to which demographics group the user belongs (e.g., young vs. elderly or male vs. female). At an empirical level, as two representative case studies into such conceptual attacks, we present a concrete brainwave privacy attack, (Brain) Hemorrhage11In the context of our work, the term “Hemorrhage” is an attack against brainwave privacy. Brain Hemorrhage is a type of alcoholic cocktail, and hence the terminology is also intended to capture one of the case studies of our work on Alcohol Use Disorder., focusing on the leakage of Alcohol Usage Disorder (AUD) and users' age group. Hemorrhage is designed using machine learning techniques to identify the users suffering from AUD and age group by analyzing the seemingly innocuous brainwave signals leaked online in response to users' viewing of simple images or watching of videos. Based on the publicly available EEG datasets on AUD and aging, our study shows that Hemorrhage can predict the presence or absence of alcohol usage disorder with the precision of 96% and the presence or absence of aging condition with 94% accuracy. We also analyze, visualize and interpret the differences in the brainwave signals corresponding to AUD and aging, which serves to justify why our attack succeeds. While the use of neuroimaging devices to diagnose medical disorders in clinical settings is a common practice in the medical field, our study constitutes one of the first steps towards exploring the malicious use of brainwave devices in compromising people's health information privacy in an online setting (otherwise protected under the HIPAA law) as well as their age privacy. Given any website can have unfettered, permission-less access to the signals captured by the current BCI devices, we believe that our work raises a serious online health privacy and age privacy issues as these devices get widely deployed.","2643-4202","978-1-7281-3265-5","10.1109/PST47121.2019.8949062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949062","","","","7","","65","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the signal subspace is estimated by applying the singular value decomposition (SVD). Orthonormal projecting the raw data onto the estimated signal subspace can obtain a pre-denoised signal and it whitened the colored noise.

It raises the risk of stroke, coronary disease, depression, and hypertension. Evidence suggests a significant impact on cortical brain activity during stressful events. If these brain activities are detected timely, the negative outcomes of stress can be reduced by coping mechanisms, personalized interventions, and timely support. In addition, detection of multilevel stress may facilitate early interventions. Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors have been a potential marker for mental stress classification. However, the heterogeneity in manual feature extraction across researchers makes it difficult to standardize the classification pipeline. Moreover, the feature extraction process requires expert knowledge. To eliminate the need for feature extraction, the present study proposes an end-to-end multilevel mental stress classification from 64-channel EEG sensors using the fusion of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), squeeze excitation (SE) block-enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) with self-attention-based deep learning model, StreXNet. The results illustrate the improved classification accuracy, in comparison to previous studies, of the proposed StreXNet model with  $91.60~\pm ~3.01$ % and  $91.81~\pm ~4.26$ % for two-class and four-class classification, respectively.

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method to capture neural signals with high temporal resolution, making it well-suited for studying real-time brain activity during dynamic tasks like gaming. Such signals are non-stationary and exhibit a non-linear manifold nature, which makes it difficult in classifying into different states during interaction. Topological data learning (TDL) framework can help in this context. However, there has been limited study conducted on the application of TDL framework for the purpose of characterizing and classifying EEG data. Therefore, this work utilizes topological attributes like Betti numbers and persistent homology of dimension 0 and 1 extracted from EEG signals to study the neural activity of an individual. Random forest classifier is used to classify the EEG signals during game interaction with accuracy $84.49 \%$. Results show that the performance is at par with deep learning approaches even when less number of topological features are used.

To investigate possible mechanisms of tACS, we extracted neural manifold changes derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during working memory (WM) tasks before and after tACS and explored the relationship between these manifold changes and behavioral performance. Our findings revealed that exposure to tACS delivered at y frequency (γ-tACS) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) resulted in an expansion of the low-dimensional trajectories of brain activity, and this expansion was associated with adaptations that maintained behavioral stability.

Next, correlation analysis was performed between various features and anxiety level changes that were predetermined at each stage of the experiment using a 5-point Likert scale, and the most relevant features were collected. Then, different classifiers were applied to classify four anxiety levels using different features alone or together to explore their anxiety recognition ability. Based on our dataset, the highest accuracy of identifying four anxiety states reached approximately 62.56 percent using the Support Vector Machine (SVM), which improved the classification accuracy compared with previous studies. The results also revealed the importance of EEG linear features (especially for features including total power, mean square and variance) in anxiety recognition. Furthermore, it suggested that EEG features in the beta band and the frontal lobe contributed to anxiety recognition more than the features in the other bands or other brain locations.

By utilizing the data we collected during the object recognition and identification experiment, we scrutinized EEGNet models, trained using channels that replicate the two-stream hypothesis pathways, against a model trained using all available channels. The outcomes reveal that the model trained solely using the temporal region delivered a high accuracy level in classifying four distinct object categories. Specifically, the object recognition and object identification models achieved an accuracy of 89% and 85%, respectively. By incorporating the channels that mimic the ventral stream, the model’s accuracy was further improved, with the object recognition model and object identification model achieving an accuracy of 95% and 94%, respectively. Furthermore, the Grad-CAM result of the trained models revealed a significant contribution from the ventral and dorsal stream channels toward the training of the EEGNet model.

The time-locked capture of the EEG to the external stimuli is known as Event-Related Potential (ERP) and it can help elucidate how the brain responds to the stimuli. In general, EEG is an uneven mixture of neural and non-neural sources of activities and these non-neural (non-EEG) signals produce artifacts in the EEG that can decrease the SNR in experiments and may lead to erroneous conclusions about the effects of experimental manipulation. Thus, it is very important to remove artifacts from the recorded EEG prior to analysis. The most common artifacts impacting ERPs are eye-blink, eye-movement, and body-movement. These artifacts-corrupted data can be removed by visual inspection or by computer-automated signal processing methods. While these methods are suitable for post-processing of collected ERP applications, they not well-suited for real-time processing of continuous ERP data. This project seeks to address the challenges associated with real-time identification of artifacts by introducing a machine learning model that can screen ERP, detect and reject artifact-corrupted data epochs prior to signal analysis. In addition to enabling real-time pre-processing of streaming ERP data, the DBScan machine-learning methods explored here can provide up to 90% accuracy in the identification of artifacts-mixed ERP epochs. As a result, the findings of this study will help to improve the signal quality of ERP trials and will enable ERP to be used as a biomarker in real-world applications where streaming EEG data collection and analysis are required.","","978-1-6654-1014-4","10.1109/CDMA54072.2022.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736362","Electroencephalography (EEG);Event-Related Potential (ERP);artifacts;noisy epochs;detection","Visualization;Electric potential;Neural activity;Machine learning;Inspection;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems","","3","","20","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess association between the Subthreshold Autism Trait Questionnaire (SATQ) score and the ERP amplitude or latency.

In this article, we propose and validate a novel implicit measure to predict an individual's levels in the Big Five personality traits from 5 minutes of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Participants viewed Chinese words with positive, negative, and neutral emotions. The multi-channel event-related potentials elicited by these emotional words were used to train a sparse regression model for personality prediction. Results from a large test sample of 196 participants indicated that the personality scores derived from the proposed measure reached significant correlations with a commonly used questionnaire (r = .50, .60, .49, .55, and .49 for agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion, respectively). The EEG-based personality scores showed good external validity as well, capable of predicting behavioral indices and psychological adjustment similar to self-reported scores. Besides, the EEG-based scores were relatively stable across time, as reflected by the test-retest reliability of .5 ∼ .7 for the five personality traits within a cohort of 33 participants 19-78 days later. These evaluations suggest that the proposed measure can serve as a viable alternative to conventional personality questionnaires in practice.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2020.3008775","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFB1001200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736220,61977041); Ministry of Education China(grant numbers:17YJA190017); National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:17ZDA323); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:20197010006); Tsinghua University School of Social Sciences & Institute for Data Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9143398","Personality assessment;emotion words;event-related potentials;EEG;predictive model","Electroencephalography;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Brain modeling;Predictive models;Reliability;Psychology","","11","","112","IEEE","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of training users to develop new skills or strategies allwoing the users best control their brain signals by rewarding better performance with appropiate feedback, this paper exploited to augment driven neuroelectic responses to externally stimuli by presenting the visual stimulus at the time when brain fall in the state of effective processing the stimulus. Our work present electrophysiological evidence showing that the amplitudes of ERP(event related potential) component P300 indicating the brain recognitive state is actually modulated periodically. Firstly, we separated stimulus evoked response from ongoing spontaneous EEG with differentially variable component analysis (dVCA) method, and then analyzed correlation between amplitudes of P300 and the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations with circular-linear correlation. The ERP component P300 evoked by stimulus may reflect the human cognitive processing, such as visual information recognition, and the ongoing EEG oscillations relate to subsecond fluctuations of neuronal excitability. So, correlation analysis of ERP amplitudes and Ongoing EEG oscillations phases reveal the brain states that conducive for stimulus presentation. Our analysis demonstrated that amplitude of P300 induced with visual stimulus actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of spontaneous oscillations in the alpha (6.6 Hz) frequency band just about 396 milliseconds before stimulus onset. This fluctuation suggests that our perceptional and cognitive system in fact exerts its facilitative effect on P300 in a periodic fashion. Thus, we can record augmented P300 by presenting stilulus during the optimal state conducive for visual stimulus processing. Our study may help to improve reactive BCI where brain activity arise in reaction to external stimulation.","","978-1-4673-1618-7","10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275697","P300;spontaneous EEG;Circular-linear correlation;dVCA;Reactive BCI","Electroencephalography;Algorithm design and analysis","","","","15","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the RSVP experiments with three different target types of pictures, words and numbers at the presentation rates of 100 and 200 ms were conducted. EEG data and pupillometry data were synchronously collected from 20 university students. The results of ERP analysis showed that, among three different target types at the presentation rate of 100 ms, the picture P300 component had the largest amplitude and the longest latency. From the 100 ms presentation rates to 200 ms one for the three target types, the P300 amplitudes became smaller, and the P300 latencies became shorter. The results of pupillometry analysis showed that, at the presentation rates of 100 and 200 ms, the pupil dilation of pictures had the smallest amplitude and the shortest latency. At the two presentation rates, no significant differences of pupil size and latency were found for the three target types. For the early pupil dilation within 1000 ms, the picture pupil size was significantly smaller than the other ones, and the picture pupil acceleration had the largest average amplitude and the shortest latency. These pupillometry features within 1000 ms combining with the P300 features could be taken as the effective ones for target classification. Through synchronization analysis of the EEG data and pupillometry data, the effects of target type and presentation rate on ERP and pupil dilation were different. These results could contribute to developing the fusion methods between EEG and eye-tracking, and provide valuable references for the multi-target recognition of hybrid BCI based on eye-tracking.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3263502","Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030339001); Beijing Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:Z201100004420015); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601028,61431007,U2241208); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:YFB1002505); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:FRF-TP-20-017A1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089873","Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP);hybrid brain-computer interface (HBCI);electroencephalography (EEG);P300;pupillometry","Electroencephalography;Pupils;Task analysis;Presses;Videos;Target recognition;Gaze tracking","Humans;Evoked Potentials;Electroencephalography;Event-Related Potentials, P300;Attention;Recognition, Psychology","7","","41","CCBY","31 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Graph theoretical analysis was applied to these matrices using two measures: the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length. We found the network organization of the EEG gamma oscillation during emotion processing showed characteristic of small-world networks; this type of organization is slightly but significantly more evident during negative emotional processing.

To date, several classification methods using only single-trial EEG signals have been studied. In some cases, the machine learning models were used for the classifications; however, the relationship between the constructed model and the characteristics of ERPs remains unclear. In this study, the LightGBM model was constructed for each individual to classify a single-trial waveform and visualize the relationship between these features and the characteristics of ERPs. The features used in the model were the average values and standard deviation of the EEG amplitude with a time width of 10 ms. The best area under the curve (AUC) score was 0.92, but, in some cases, the AUC scores were low. Large individual differences in AUC scores were observed. In each case, on checking the importance of the features, high importance was shown at the 10-ms time width section, where a large difference was observed in ERP waveforms between the target and the non-target. Since the model constructed in this study was found to reflect the characteristics of ERP, as the next step, we would like to try to improve the discrimination performance by using stimuli that the participants can concentrate on with interest.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629947","","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Biological system modeling;Data visualization;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Machine Learning","","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, they switch to another therapy which is easier and simpler but deliver similar side effects as meditation i.e. brainwave entrainment. Binaural beat is one type of such brainwave entrainments, in which two signals with different frequency are presented to each ear simultaneously. In regards to this, our research work focuses on studying the effects of binaural-beats to people with stress, specifically the effects to their EEG signals. In such context, this paper presents the results collected from the experiments performed on a number of participants. EEG signals of the participants are recorded in three different states namely the initial state, after stress induction and after binaural-beats entrainment.

For this reason, the impedance between each individual electrode and the scalp is measured prior to each EEG recording session. In order to obtain high quality EEG signals and accurate performance, the impedance has to be low (below 5K Ohms). Typically, researchers have reduced the electrode-scalp impedance by performing time-consuming electrode adjustments prior to the data acquisition stage. In this paper, we utilize the electrode-scalp impedance information to remove the EEG artifacts caused by high impedance electrodes in order to enhance the signal quality during the signal processing stage. Our proposed method is based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which is used to decompose the EEG signals into independent components. The electrode-scalp impedance is employed to automatically distinguish irrelevant components from event-related components. The experimental results show that our method can effectively remove artifacts and enhance the BCI performance compared to the scenario where no artifacts were removed, and the scenario in which irrelevant independent components were removed manually based on prior knowledge.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853960","EEG;ICA;Electrode-scalp impedance","Conferences;Acoustics;Speech;Speech processing","","5","","19","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over 13 weeks, our longitudinal study focuses on the real-life experiences of college students, collecting data from each of the 18 participants across multiple days in classroom settings. To tackle the complexity arising from the multitude of EEG features and the imbalance in data samples across stress levels, we use the sequential backward selection (SBS) method for feature selection and the adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling algorithm for imbalanced data. Our findings unveil that delta and theta features account for approximately 50% of the selected features through the SBS process. In leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, the combination of band power and pair-wise coherence (COH) achieves a maximum balanced accuracy of 94.8% in stress-level detection for the above daily stress dataset. Notably, using ADASYN and borderline synthesized minority over-sampling technique (borderline-SMOTE) methods enhances model accuracy compared to the traditional SMOTE approach.

We assume that the subjects undergo through five different stress levels i.e. ‘Relaxed’, ‘Less stressed’, ‘Moderately Stressed’, ‘High Stressed’ and ‘Alarmingly Stressed’ while solving these question sets. After that recorded EEG data is processed and features are extracted. We design a feed forward neural network for classifying the stress level in human brain. We prepare a new question set consisting of easy as well as complex numerical questions for testing purpose. We record the EEG data of a subject while solving this question set. We extract six feature values from the processed EEG data of the subject. These data is fed to the designed feed forward neural network. The neural network predicts the stress level and the predicted stress level is indicated in the ‘Stress Indicating’ circuit.","","978-1-5386-7989-0","10.1109/ICACCP.2019.8882906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882906","EEG;Feature Extraction;Neural Network;Stress Indicating Circuit","Stress;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Biological neural networks;Complexity theory;Artificial neural networks;Fourier transforms","","20","","10","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually investigated by the group-level analysis, for which tensor factorization can be used. However, sizes of a tensor including time-frequency representation of ERPs of multiple channels of multiple participants can be immense. It is time-consuming to decompose such a tensor. The low-rank approximation based sequential nonnegative Tucker decomposition (LraSNTD) has been recently developed and shown to be computationally efficient with respect to some benchmark datasets. Here, LraSNTD is applied to decompose a fourth-order tensor representation of ERPs. We find that the decomposed results from LraSNTD and a benchmark nonnegative Tucker decomposition algorithm are very similar.

For rapid testing and practical limitations, such applications require the use of low-density electrode arrays. A major impediment to their use in these applications is the lack of denoising techniques capable of removing artefactual contamination and isolating the ERPs features of interest within low-density arrays. Methods: A novel denoising technique combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with template matching procedure is developed and applied to individual-channel data, and the results of this new approach are compared to the results of a conventional (independent component analysis) denoising approach. Both whole-epoch morphological comparisons and specific ERP feature amplitude comparisons were undertaken at the group and individual level for a variety of ERPs indexing sensory (N100), attention (P300) and language processing (N400) using data from 31 healthy adults. Results: The new denoising technique successfully enables the capture of ERPs ranging from low-level sensation to attention to language processing (all p<; 0.05). Intra-class correlation analysis reveals high degree of similarity in the time series waveforms derived from the new and the conventional denoising approaches for all ERPs (highest r=0.89, all p<; 0.001). Analysis of specific ERP features of interest reveals no significant differences between the ERP amplitudes of the waveforms generated using the two techniques, and Pearson correlation suggests a high degree of similarity at the individual level (0.88 for N100, 0.78 for P300, and 0.80 for N400, all p<; 0.05). Conclusion: The new denoising technique is capable of operating on individual-channel EEG data, and produces results that are similar to those produced by conventional denoising techniques that use data from large whole-head electrode arrays. This new approach may thus enable more widespread use of ERP techniques in real world settings with low-density electrode arrays.","","978-1-7281-9615-2","10.1109/IEMTRONICS51293.2020.9216365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216365","biomedical signal processing;neurotechnology;electroencephalography (EEG);neural signal processing;empirical mode decomposition (EMD);artifact removal","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Noise reduction;Arrays;Time series analysis;Correlation;Transforms","","5","","21","IEEE","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extending their method the authors present a solution in which amplitude variability is also allowed. The utility of the solution to estimate the P3 component in single trials was investigated both by extensive pseudoreal simulations and in an application to real data.

Various factors such as personal relationships, work pressure, financial problems, or major life changes, impact both emotional and physical well-being. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals serve as insightful indicators of brain activity, resembling tiny electrical whispers exchanged between brain cells. These brain cells are characterized by EEG patterns such as alpha, beta, theta, and gamma frequency band waves, and offer valuable insights such as frequency analysis, categorization of valence and arousal, and machine learning techniques, into distinct mental states and neural activity. The exploratory data analytics (EDA) techniques using ML methods (KNN, SVM, and RF) on EEG dataset is being performed to analyze mental stress detection. Furthermore, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores of the KNN, SVM, and RF models are compared based on the number of folds, which shows that KNN has the lowest MAE of 0.62, compared to SVM scores of 0.83 and RF score of 1.47 respectively. As a result, the KNN model is selected for stress detection due to its superior performance in reducing MAE in both iterations and training data sizes. Furthermore, the study concisely also reviews an existing literature on mental stress detection using EEG signals, highlighting prevalent challenges and research gaps.","","979-8-3503-6115-5","10.1109/INCET61516.2024.10592994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10592994","Mental Stress;EEG Signals (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Theta);Exploratory data analytics (EDA);Machine Learning (ML);Deep Learning (DL)","Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Reviews;Psychology;Human factors;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor methods","","4","","27","IEEE","26 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous exposure to stress can greatly impact mental activity as well as physical health thereby leading to several diseases. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of audio binaural beat stimulation (BBs) in mitigating mental stress. We developed an experimental protocol to induce four mental states: rest, control, stress, and stress mitigation. The stress was induced by utilizing Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) with time constraints and mitigated, by listening to 16 Hz of BBs. The four mental states were assessed using behavioral responses (accuracy of target detection), a perceived stress state questionnaire (PSS-10), and electroencephalography (EEG). The mean spectral power of four frequency bands was estimated using Power Spectral Density (PSD), and five different machine learning classifiers were used to classify the four mental states. Our results show that SCWT reduced the detection accuracy by 59.58% while listening to 16-Hz BBs significantly increased the accuracy of detection by 27.08%, (p = .00392). Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) significantly outperformed other classifiers achieving the highest accuracy of 82.5 ± 2.0 % using the beta band information. Similarly, the PSD topographical maps showed different patterns between the four mental states, where the temporal region’s PSD was mostly affected by stress. Nevertheless, under mitigation, there was a noticeable restoration in the temporal activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that BBs at 16 Hz can be used to mitigate stress levels.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340673","American University of Sharjah; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340673","Binaural Beat Stimulation;EEG;mental stress;PSD;SVM","Support vector machines;Protocols;Human factors;Machine learning;Object detection;Color;Electroencephalography","Humans;Electroencephalography;Stress, Psychological;Machine Learning","4","","21","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A data-adaptive clustering method was used to extract Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstates, and changes in these microstates were analyzed in relation to correct and incorrect responses. The results show that when cognitive errors occur, the transition probability of microstates associated with the attention network increases by 86%, while the transition probability of microstates related to the language-visual network increases by 68%. This suggests that, in the case of cognitive errors, the brain activates the attention and language-visual networks to enhance the evaluation of the situation and external information, as well as the processing of language and visual inputs, in order to better correct errors and adjust cognitive strategies.

The present study aims to discuss the auditory sensory gating effect on the dynamical complexity of brain activity in schizophrenia compared to normal control groups. Event-related Electroencephalograms (EEG) during the standard P50 sensory gating test were recorded from 9 schizophrenia and 14 normal controls. A nonlinear dynamic method, Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) measure was used in this study. LZC can explore the dynamical complexity of brain activity under mental task. The research discovered that the schizophrenia showed significantly different LZC effects on the paired stimuli (s1 and s2) from normal group at certain area (Cz, p=0.000; T7, p=0.002; and Fz, p=0.034). Normal subjects have significant lower complexities for s1 than that for s2. However, the schizophrenia group did not show obvious LZC differences between s1 and s2. We also did classical analysis of event-related potential (ERP). The P50 component was analyzed and the consistent results were found with LZC. The P50 suppression shows obvious inhibition when s2 comes for the normal group but not for the schizophrenia group. The neurophysiological theory tells that, the first stimuli s1 activates an inhibitory system, suppressing the response to s2 for normal people. While, the schizophrenia show reduced suppression when s2 comes, which indicate the abnormality of auditory sensory gating. The schizophrenia was unable to filter out irrelevant stimuli, resulting in perceptual abnormalities. We therefore deduced that, the increase of LZC represented the order of neurons activities declined while brain disregarding irrelevant stimuli. In conclusion, LZC analysis may be another important way to understand the sensory gating in future studies.","1948-2922","978-1-4244-9352-4","10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098457","sensory gating;schizophrenia;Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC);EEG","Brain;Electroencephalography;Complexity theory;Psychiatry;Statistical analysis;Filtering theory;Neurons","","1","","12","IEEE","12 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.891164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237343","Cognitive state;event-related potential;fuzzy neural network;independent component analysis;principle component analysis;temporal filter;virtual reality","Enterprise resource planning;Independent component analysis;Electroencephalography;Virtual reality;Road accidents;Humans;Information security;Information analysis;Virtual environment;Working environment noise","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automobile Driving;Cognition;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Female;Humans;Male;Motor Skills;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Visual Cortex","85","","17","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To determine the time at which cognitive load is at its peak, oddball tones may be applied at various times surrounding a cognitive task. However, we need to determine whether the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual stimuli would mask a potential change in P3 in an ERP-producing task. If the contribution of the Stroop stimulus is too large, then Stroop ERP with oddball stimuli occurring at different timepoints may not be directly comparable across the various timepoints due to the contribution of the Stroop ERP. The aim of this study was to measure the magnitude of the difference wave between that of simultaneously presented stimuli and that of linearly added stimuli of separate responses. Participants were fitted with a dry-sensor EEG cap and were presented with a series of Stroop and auditory stimuli. For some Stroop stimuli, auditory stimuli occurred simultaneously or in a close time proximity to the Stroop stimuli. We sought to estimate the linear contribution of the ERP from Stroop and oddball stimuli. We found that the magnitude of the difference waves were 3.07 ± 1.65 μV and 2.82 ± 1.34 μV for congruent and incongruent stimuli, respectively. As the average amplitude in the P3 region for both the congruent and incongruent difference waves was lower than the magnitude of the auditory oddball presented simultaneously with Stroop stimuli (12.13 ± 1.00 μV for congruent and 11.78 ± 1.05 μV for incongruent Stroop), we expect that the contribution of P3 auditory oddball would not mask a potential Stroop effect even if the timing of the auditory oddball stimuli were experimentally manipulated, a direction that we hope to explore in future work. In conclusion, we determine this paradigm is suitable for measuring cognitive load in precisely timed tasks.Clinical Relevance— This study establishes the efficacy of presenting a Stroop task as a proxy for a cognitive challenge that could cause cognitive overload.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341143","","Visualization;Atmospheric measurements;Cognitive load;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Biology;Timing","Humans;Event-Related Potentials, P300;Stroop Test;Electroencephalography;Reaction Time;Evoked Potentials","","","10","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An EEG is generally measured from electrodes placed on the scalp. However, it is not suitable for daily use because the preparation time is relatively long, and the electrodes are likely to cause discomfort to the user. EEG measurements from disposable electrodes placed on the forehead (forehead EEG) have been used to mitigate this disadvantage. However, because many ERP components used in BCI show the maximal voltage on the scalp, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ERPs obtained from a forehead EEG is low, which may affect the reliability of a BCI system. To address this shortcoming, we propose convolutional neural networks that predict the EEG signal measured from electrodes placed on the scalp (scalp EEG) from forehead EEG. In the study, we focused on predicting the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, and single-trial scalp EEG at Fz was predicted from three forehead EEG measures (Fpz, horizontal, and vertical electrooculograms). Data were measured while nine subjects performed a passive auditory oddball task. To evaluate the proposed model, the mean squared error (MSE) between the observed single-trial EEG at Fz and the predicted single-trial EEG from three forehead EEG measures was calculated, as well as the MSE between the observed ERP difference wave (deviant – standard) at Fz and the difference wave predicted from three forehead EEG measures within the time window in which MMN was observed. The result showed that within the time window in which MMN was observed, the MSE between the ERP difference wave at Fz and the ERP difference wave predicted from three forehead EEG measures was significantly smaller than the MSE between the ERP difference wave at Fz and the ERP difference wave at the forehead (Fpz). This indicates that the proposed neural network improved the SNR of the forehead EEG for predicting ERP responses at the scalp and could lead to enhancing the usefulness of forehead EEG for BCI use in daily life.","","978-1-6654-8574-6","10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967638","electroencephalogram (EEG);convolutional neural networks;forehead EEG;mismatch negativity (MMN);event-related potential (ERP)","Electrodes;Electric potential;Forehead;Scalp;Measurement uncertainty;Electroencephalography;Time measurement","","","","17","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Little has been done on the effects of subject variability, both across individuals and within the same individual, on BCI performance. For example, stress, arousal, motivation, and fatigue can all affect the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals used by a BCI, which in turn impacts performance. Overcoming the impact of such user variability on BCI performance is an impending and inevitable challenge for routine applications of BCIs in the real world. To systematically explore the factors affecting BCI performance, this study embeds a Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based BCI into a “game with a purpose” (GWAP) to obtain data over significant lengths of time, under both high- and low-stress conditions. Ten healthy volunteers played a GWAP that resembles popular match-three games, such as Jewel Quest, Zoo Boom, or Candy Crush. We recorded the target search time, target search accuracy, and EEG signals during gameplay to investigate the impacts of stress on EEG signals and BCI performance. We used Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to determine whether the subject had found and attended to the correct target. The experimental results show that SSVEP target-classification accuracy is reduced by stress. We also found a negative correlation between EEG spectra and the SNR of EEG in the frontal and occipital regions during gameplay, with a larger negative correlation for the high-stress conditions. Furthermore, CCA also showed that when the EEG alpha and theta power increased, the search accuracy decreased, and the spectral amplitude drop was more evident under the high-stress situation. These results provide new, valuable insights into research on how to improve the robustness of BCIs in real-world applications.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3005771","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-009-150,MOST 108-2221-E-009-045-MY3,MOST 108-2321-B-010-014-MY2,MOST 108-2918-I-009-006); Center for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-devices (IDS²B) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project; Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-10-2-0022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127967","Brain computer interface (BCI);steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP);electroencephalogram (EEG);stress","Electroencephalography;Stress;Games;Steady-state;Correlation;Drugs;Visualization","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Humans;Photic Stimulation","26","","42","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since there is an evidence of relationship between attention and P3 component which is widely used in design and analysis of experiments by the method of event related potentials (ERPs), the ERP experiment based on auditory stimulation was designed and performed on tested subjects, which drove a car simulator on a monotonous track. The background of the used method, experimental design, data processing, and results of the performed experiments are described in this paper.","","978-1-4673-1184-7","10.1109/BMEI.2012.6513051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513051","neuroinformatics;electroencephalography;event related potentials;EEG/ERP experiment;driver's attention;car simulator;P3 component;peak latency","","","","","12","IEEE","4 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We aim to identify abnormal neural activity and reorganization in tinnitus patients and reveal potential neurophysiological markers for objectively evaluating tinnitus. By way of analyzing EEG microstates, comparing metrics under three resting states (OE, CE, and OECEm) between tinnitus sufferers and controls, and correlating them with tinnitus symptoms. This study reflected specific changes in the EEG microstates of tinnitus patients across multiple resting states, as well as inconsistent correlations with tinnitus symptoms. Microstate parameters were significantly different when patients were in OE and CE states. Specifically, the occurrence of Microstate A and the transition probabilities (TP) from other Microstates to A increased significantly, particularly in the CE state (32-37%,  ${p}\le 0.05$ ); and both correlated positively with the tinnitus intensity. Nevertheless, under the OECEm state, increases were mainly observed in the duration, coverage, and occurrence of Microstate B (15-47%,  ${p} < 0.05$ ), which negatively correlated with intensity ( $\text{R} < $ -0.513,  ${p} < 0.05$ ). Additionally, TPx between Microstates C and D were significantly reduced and positively correlated with HDAS levels ( $\text{R}>$  0.548,  ${p} < 0.05$ ).

Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340715","Stress monitoring;Multi-modal;Entropy profile;non-EEG data;Continuous monitoring;Remote monitoring","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Heart rate;Temperature distribution;Wearable computers;Anxiety disorders;Human factors","Adult;Humans;Electroencephalography;Wakefulness;Machine Learning;Mental Disorders;Heart Rate","1","","23","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lack of proper sleep can impair functionality and overall health. While stress is known for its detrimental impact on sleep quality, the precise effect of pre-sleep stress on subsequent sleep structure remains unknown. This study introduced a novel approach to study the pre-sleep stress effect on sleep structure, specifically slow-wave sleep (SWS) deficiency. To achieve this, we selected forehead resting EEG immediately before and upon sleep onset to extract stress-related neurological markers through power spectra and entropy analysis. These markers include beta/delta correlation, alpha asymmetry, fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn) and spectral entropy (SpEn). Fifteen subjects were included in this study. Our results showed that subjects lacking SWS often exhibited signs of stress in EEG, such as an increased beta/delta correlation, higher alpha asymmetry, and increased FuzzEn in frontal EEG. Conversely, individuals with ample SWS displayed a weak beta/delta correlation and reduced FuzzEn. Finally, we employed several supervised learning models and found that the selected neurological markers can predict subsequent SWS deficiency. Our investigation demonstrated that the classifiers could effectively predict varying levels of slow-wave sleep (SWS) from pre-sleep EEG segments, achieving a mean balanced accuracy surpassing 0.75.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a suitable estimation mechanism to assess the EC network underlying the SAD data, due to its high temporal resolution. EEG data were acquired from 20 subjects divided to 5 severe, 5 average, 5 mild, and 5 healthy control (HC) in the anticipation time (before delivering a speech in public). The EEG data was used to estimate the EC network using the phase slope index (PSI) algorithm in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The difference between the PSI metrics in all the SAD groups was significant ( ). EEG results showed that the severe and average groups have greater EC in the left hemisphere for alpha networks, while mild and HC groups have shown greater EC networks in the right hemisphere. The midparietal lobe has shown to be the main brain hub in the severe group, while the right frontal cortex has shown to be the major brain hub for HC.

We develop a computational model to quantify subject performance and the difficulty of realistic stimuli. Our results show that: (1) more difficult trials produce less prominent ERP patterns, thus reducing the performance of machine-based ERP detection; (2) on average for the same behavioral performance level, a pair of ERP's extracted from two easy trials are more similar than a pair of ERP's from two hard trials; and (3) both stimulus and task difficulty are correlated with neural activity.

However, if responses from multiple cognitive processes, time locked to multiple classes of closely spaced events, overlap in time with varying inter-event intervals, averaging will most likely fail to identify the individual response time courses. For this situation, we study estimation of responses to all recorded events in an experiment by a single model using standard linear regression (the rERP technique). Applied to data collected during a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task, our analysis shows: (1) The rERP technique accounts for more variance in the data than averaging when individual event responses are highly overlapping; (2) the variance accounted for by the estimates is concentrated into a fewer ICA components than raw EEG channel signals.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609841","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Visualization;Signal to noise ratio;Integrated circuits;Linear regression;Computational modeling","Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Linear Models;Visual Perception","19","","15","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stroop color-word test was chosen for stress induction. Twenty-one participants with right-handed were grouped by randomly assigned music tempo (N = 7 in each group) and their brain activity was recorded. The results show that beta activity was increased at the right frontal region in Stroop color-word test . During listening on each music tempo, the brain activities showed significantly decrease in beta activity comparing to Stroop color-word test . Also, the normal music tempo is the most effective for decrease of beta activity at right frontal region comparing to the others.

Here, we introduce differentially variable component analysis (dVCA) method to estimate the P300 amplitude in each trial, and extract theta rhythm from spontaneous EEG free of ERPs, which allows the interaction between ERPs and the ongoing EEG to be investigated directly. We test our methods on dataset from Eriksen flanker experiments. Our result shows that the method using dVCA can perform well to extract ERP variables and remove ERP from spontaneous EEG.

As it has been proven that stress and mental workload are proportionally correlated, several studies have proposed algorithms for stress monitoring by increasing the mental workload. Despite the promising results reported in the literature, a majority of the proposed algorithms require the employment of several physiological signals which hinder their real-life application. Nonetheless, the advent of low-cost wearable devices has provided a new possibility for outdoor stress monitoring. The objective of this paper is to present an algorithm for stress detection using low-channel prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) data. Methods: Firstly, artifacts in EEG signals are removed. Secondly, EEG signals are split into sub-bands using the discrete wavelet transform and two nonlinear parameter-free features are extracted. Thirdly, the extracted features are fed to three classifiers, i.e., support vector machine, Adaboost, and the K-Nearest Neighbours to discriminate stress from relaxed states. Main results: According to the obtained results, the highest accuracy (80.24%) was achieved using the AdaBoost classifier. Significance:Given that the proposed method does not require any parameter adjustment before processing, it has the potential to be used in real-world scenarios.","","978-1-6654-9384-0","10.1109/MeMeA57477.2023.10171942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171942","Cognitive load;Stress;EEG;Wearable;Nonlinear feature","Support vector machines;Wearable computers;Employment;Human factors;Transforms;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography","","8","","19","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates.

Decoding neural patterns or its classification is a challenging task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are non-invasive neuroimaging modalities to capture the brain activity pattern in term of images and electric potential respectively. To get higher spatiotemporal resolution of human brain from these two complementary neuroimaging modalities, simultaneous EEG-fMRI can be helpful. In this paper, we proposed a framework for classifying the brain activity patterns with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We have acquired five human participants' data with simultaneous EEG-fMRI by showing different object categories. Further, combined analysis of EEG and fMRI data was carried out. Extracted information through combine analysis is passed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification purpose. We have achieved better classification accuracy using simultaneous EEG-fMRI i.e., 81.8% as compared to fMRI data standalone. This shows that multimodal neuroimaging can improve the classification accuracy of brain activity patterns as compared to individual modalities reported in literature.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318735","","Electroencephalography;Brain;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Visualization;Neuroimaging;Data acquisition","Adult;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multimodal Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Visual","2","","15","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early detection of MCI is essential for implementing preventative strategies that can delay or prevent the onset of dementia, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown significant promise in detecting MCI due to their affordability, real-time monitoring capabilities, and noninvasiveness. EEG provides continuous brain activity data, while ERPs offer insights into specific cognitive processes by analyzing brain responses to stimuli. These methods can complement each other in MCI diagnosis by providing a comprehensive view of overall brain function and detailed information on specific cognitive processes. However, EEG and ERP are susceptible to noise and interindividual variability, which can hinder their reliability. In addition, applying machine learning models on EEG or ERP for MCI detection presents challenges such as the risk of overfitting and difficulties in interpreting the underlying decision-making process. This review emphasizes recent advancements in signal processing and feature extraction methods applied to EEG and ERP data and explores the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and interpretative depth. By integrating these methodologies, the review highlights how EEG and ERP can contribute to a more effective understanding and monitoring of cognitive changes associated with MCI, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis for timely intervention and improved patient care.

This paper designed and carried out the pre-experiment and formal experiment of cognitive error prediction experiment, and collected the original EEG data when cognitive error occurred. After the original EEG data is obtained, the collected original EEG data are preprocessed.

In addition, chronic stress could implicate several psychophysiological disorders. For example, stress increases the likelihood of depression, stroke, heart attack, and cardiac arrest. The latest neuroscience reveals that the human brain is the primary target of mental stress, because the perception of the human brain determines a situation that is threatening and stressful. In this context, an objective measure for identifying the levels of stress while considering the human brain could considerably improve the associated harmful effects. Therefore, in this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework involving electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis of stressed participants is proposed. In the experimental setting, stress was induced by adopting a well-known experimental paradigm based on the montreal imaging stress task. The induction of stress was validated by the task performance and subjective feedback. The proposed ML framework involved EEG feature extraction, feature selection (receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test and the Bhattacharya distance), classification (logistic regression, support vector machine and naïve Bayes classifiers) and tenfold cross validation. The results showed that the proposed framework produced 94.6% accuracy for two-level identification of stress and 83.4% accuracy for multiple level identification. In conclusion, the proposed EEG-based ML framework has the potential to quantify stress objectively into multiple levels.

When using electroencephalography (EEG) in daily applications, coping with ocular-motor artifacts and ensuring that the equipment is user-friendly are both important. To address the first issue, we applied a previously proposed method that applies an unmixing matrix to acquire independent components (ICs) obtained from another dataset. For the second issue, we introduced a 14-channel EEG commercial headset called the “Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset”. An advantage of the Emotiv headset is that users can put it on by themselves within 1 min without any specific skills. However, only a few studies have investigated whether EEG and ERP signals are accurately measured by Emotiv. Additionally, no electrodes of the Emotiv headset are located over the centroparietal area of the head where P3 components are reported to show large amplitudes. Therefore, we first demonstrated that the P3 components obtained by the headset and by commercial plate electrodes and a multipurpose bioelectric amplifier during an oddball task were comparable. Next, we confirmed that eye-blink and ocular movement components could be decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) using the 14-channel signals measured by the headset. We also demonstrated that artifacts could be removed with an unmixing matrix, as long as the matrix was obtained from the same person, even if they were measured on different days. Finally, we confirmed that the fluctuation of the sampling frequency of the Emotiv headset was not a major problem.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609758","","Electroencephalography;Headphones;Electrodes;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Fluctuations;Correlation","Analog-Digital Conversion;Artifacts;Blinking;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Eye Movements;Female;Humans;Software;Young Adult","12","1","4","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results showed that the persons with acquired sensorineural hearing loss were characterized by lower scores of the emotional intelligence components and higher power of the delta rhythm than the control group. Different relations between emotional intelligence components and EEG power were revealed in these groups. The deaf group was characterized by positive correlations between the “responsive distress” component and the high-frequency gamma rhythm diffusely distributed in the cortex, whereas control group demonstrated positive relations between the “attending to emotions” component and the low-frequency theta rhythm in the posterior areas of cortex.

In a backward masking paradigm, participants first produced a forced-choice response to the location of a liminal target presented for an individually calibrated duration, and then reported on their subjective awareness of the target's presence. We recorded (Event-Related Potentials) ERPs and compared the ERP waves when observers reported being aware vs. unaware of the target but localized it correctly, thereby isolating the neural correlates of subjective awareness while controlling for differences in objective performance. In addition, we compared the ERPs when participants were subjectively unaware of the target's presence and localized it correctly versus incorrectly, thereby isolating the neural correlates of unconscious perception. All conditions involved stimuli that were physically identical and were presented for the same duration. Both behavioral measures were associated with modulation of the amplitude of the P3 component of the ERP. Importantly, this modulation was widely spread across all scalp locations for subjective awareness, but was restricted to the parietal electrodes for unconscious perception. These results indicate that liminal stimuli that do not affect performance undergo considerable processing and that subjective awareness is associated with a late wave of activation with widely distributed topography.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2009.21064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793625","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In this study, we used a speech transmission fear paradigm to induce fear and applied different automatic emotion regulation paradigms to initiate an acceptance strategy. By combining behavioral and electrophysiological methods, we examined the impact of automatic acceptance on instructed fear. The results showed that the automatic acceptance strategy could partially regulate instructed fear, significantly reducing participants' subjective feelings toward threat stimulus.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used for a long time to study and identify bio-markers. While these bio-markers have successfully predicted stress in EEG studies for binary conditions, their performance is suboptimal for multiple conditions of stress. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we propose using latent based representations of the bio-markers, which have been shown to significantly improve EEG performance compared to traditional bio-markers alone. We evaluated three commonly used EEG based bio-markers for stress, the brain load index (BLI), the spectral power values of EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta and theta), and the relative gamma (RG), with their respective latent representations using four commonly used classifiers.

In order to diagnose gaming disorders, it is of importance to understand how gaming behavior affects brain activity patterns and whether there exist differences in the effects on different individuals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate reflects a transiently stable brain topological structure with spatiotemporal characteristics, and the spatial characteristic microstate classes and temporal parameters provide insight into the brain’s functional activities in gaming disorders. In order to explore the feasibility of using EEG microstate parameters as markers of gaming addiction, in the present study, resting-state EEG data were acquired before and after playing video game for 30 minutes from 38 participants, containing gaming disorder individual (GD), recreational game users (RGU), and healthy controls (HC). Our study compared the microstate parameters before and after playing game among three groups. According to the results, the resting-state EEG microstate parameters exert no significant difference before playing game among three groups. However, we found significant difference in microstate B and D parameters among three groups after playing game. Additionally, compared with the pre-gaming, the post-gaming data showed that the variation trend of microstate B and D parameters of the three groups was similar. Moreover, these discoveries provide the first causal evidence of a microstate modification following gaming behavior interference, suggesting that microstates B and D are closely associated with gaming behavior, which can be used as EEG markers for distinguishing gaming addiction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060112","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51877067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356585","Gaming behavior;gaming disorder;microstate;resting-state EEG","Electroencephalography;Games;Brain;Surfaces;Electrodes;Coherence","","8","","59","CCBY","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mental stress can be detected in many ways and EEG is one of them. Regular mental stress gives rise to many mental disorders and it may cause various physiological and psychological diseases. As a result, early-stage detection of stress is very important. In this research, brain activity was recorded through EEG headset during inducing different levels of stress from audio-visual stimulus. Again, for better interaction between humans and machines, it is essential to analyze the power spectrum of the brain in response to different audio and visual stimulus. To better evaluate visual and auditory stress, an automated system is designed to differentiate among various audio and visual evoked potentials. This may further help for designing different assistive devices for the people having visual and hearing disability. In this paper, we proposed a framework to classify different levels of stress in response to audio and visual stimuli and also classified between these two stimuli by analyzing EEG signals. Raw EEG data was collected in lab environment and the necessary pre-processing steps were applied for denoising. By extracting robust features from the denoised audio and visual data, binary and multi-level stress were classified. A binary classification between audio and visual stimuli was also successfully done in this research. We achieved highest accuracy for binary stress classification 97.14% from visual stimuli, whereas we achieved 94.51% accuracy for auditory stimuli.

While most progress focused on innovation of sensing hardware and conductive electrodes, less effort has been done to renovate mechanical structures of an EEG headset. Recently, an electrode-holder assembly infrastructure was designed to be capable of unlimitedly (re)assembling a desired n-channel electrode headset through a set of primary elements (i.e., LEGO-like headset). The present work empirically demonstrated one of its advantage regarding coordinating the homogeneous or heterogeneous sensors covering the target regions of the brain. Towards this objective, an 8-channel LEGO headset was assembled to conduct a simultaneous event-related potential (ERP) recording of the wet- and dry-electrode EEG systems and testify their signal quality during standing still versus treadmill walking. The results showed that both systems returned a comparable P300 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for standing, yet the dry system was more susceptible to the movement artifacts during slow walking.

The fundamental objective of this paper is to enhance the perceptibility of target characters by introducing motion stimuli to classical rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) spellers that do not require any eye movement, thereby applying them to paralyzed patients with oculomotor dysfunctions. To test the feasibility of the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm, we implemented three RSVP spellers: 1) fixed-direction motion (FM-RSVP); 2) random-direction motion (RM-RSVP); and 3) (the conventional) non-motion stimulation (NM-RSVP), and evaluated the effect of the three different stimulation methods on spelling performance. The two motion-based stimulation methods, FMand RM-RSVP, showed shorter P300 latency and higher P300 amplitudes (i. e., 360.4-379.6 ms; 5.5867- 5.7662 μV) than the NM-RSVP (i.e., 480.4 ms; 4.7426 μV). This led to higher and more stable performances for FMand RM-RSVP spellers than NM-RSVP speller (i. e., 79.06±6.45% for NM-RSVP, 90.60±2.98% for RM-RSVP, and 92.74±2.55% for FM-RSVP). In particular, the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm was significantly beneficial for about half of the subjects who might not accurately perceive rapidly presented static stimuli.

Periodic oscillatory properties of brain response to external stimulation are widely studied, while aperiodic component responses remain unclear. Here, we investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of periodic and aperiodic brain activity under peripheral nerve stimulation with acupuncture by parameterization of power spectra of EEG signals. Regarding periodic brain activity, spectral peak in delta band emerges in frontal and central brain regions indicates a typical phenomenon of neural entrainment, which is formed by coupling periodic brain activity to external rhythmic acupuncture stimulation. In addition, the statistical results show that alpha periodic power is an important indicator for characterizing the modulatory effects of acupuncture on periodic brain activity. As for aperiodic brain activity, broadband EEG spectral trend analysis demonstrates a steeper aperiodic slope in left parietal lobe and a stronger negative correlation with the aperiodic offset under acupuncture compared with resting state, with the absolute value of correlation coefficient increasing from 0.27 to 0.50. Based on the two parameters that can best characterize the acupuncture effect, alpha periodic power and aperiodic slope, the accurate decoding of acupuncture manipulation is realized with AUC = 0.87.

Analyzing the patterns and frequencies of brainwave activity makes it possible to detect and classify different emotional states, such as happiness, sadness, fear, or anger. In daily life, it is evident that there are differences in how men and women think and approach various aspects, such as perceiving and experiencing emotions. Given the scarcity of research on gender-based EEG studies, it is crucial to explore this area to gain valuable insights into the unique neurological aspects of gender. This study examines gender disparities in emotion recognition using the Hjorth Parameter analysis. This study recorded the data of 24 healthy subjects (22± 5.6 years old) using a wireless OpenBCI EEG device. The participants were stimulated by seeing happy and sad videos. The electrodes used in this study were placed in the frontal area channels F7, F8, FP1, and FP2, following the internationally recognized 10/20 EEG system. EEG pre-processing techniques include signal filtering and ICA for Artifact removal. The EEG signals were separated into alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands using Butterworth filters. The analysis was to compute the Hjorth parameters: in activity, mobility, and complexity. We used the Fisher ratio to identify the most influential features, then processed and analyzed them using SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms for emotion classification. This study has shown that Hjorth Activity outperforms other Hjorth parameters, such as Hjorth mobility and complexity, in accurately recognizing emotions, and the beta subband is the most sensitive in distinguishing between happy and sad emotions. On the gender aspect, differences in emotional responses between men and women are evident. Women tend to exhibit more similar EEG patterns among themselves, while men show more significant individual differences. The other intriguing finding is that the value of the gamma subband is higher for both men and women in the sad condition, indicating that the cognitive process appears more evolved than in the happy condition.","2687-8909","979-8-3503-1473-1","10.1109/IES59143.2023.10242538","Ministry of Communication and Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10242538","Cognitive Process;EEG;Emotion Recognition;Fisher Ratio;Gamma Subband;Gender-based;Hjorth Parameter","Wireless communication;Support vector machines;Emotion recognition;Wireless sensor networks;Face recognition;Filtering algorithms;Electroencephalography","","1","","30","IEEE","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate predictions of neural responses can reduce the latencies of neural signal classification algorithms and closed-loop feedback systems. Various models of ERPs propose that there exists a causal dependency between post-event neural responses and ongoing pre-event neural dynamics. Accordingly, we implement a deep neural network that extracts features from pre-event data in order to predict a single-trial ERP. To capture the variability of a single trial, the network constructs the post-event waveform in two parts: 1) generating ongoing neural activity and 2) generating event-related components comprising the ERP. We evaluate our model by forecasting 500 milliseconds of single channel post-event data from a Rapid Series Visual Presentation (RSVP) task.

But ICA analysis of ERP has the problem that it lacks validity across subjects. Therefore, we examined a new approach to give validity across subjects to ICA results obtained from single subjects. To do this, we combined two criteria of how much a single subject's signals contain task-related components and the similarity of the spatial patterns of those task-related components across subjects. We applied our approach to EEG data recorded in an experiment. As a result, analysis with a combination of ICA and our approach extracted significantly more task-related components from the observed signals than analysis without the combination did, although both analyses suggested that the occipital area activity was most relevant to performing the task across subjects. These results suggest that our approach is useful for extracting task-related components from the observed EEG signals and for giving validity across subjects in ICA analysis of EEG/ERP","","0-7803-9732-0","10.1109/ISPACS.2006.364778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212396","","Independent component analysis;Electroencephalography;Enterprise resource planning;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Brain;Data mining;Electrodes;Scalp;Biomedical signal processing","","","","8","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems, removal of OAs is important for correctly converting the brain thoughts into commands in order to control the external device. Various techniques like Independent component Analysis (ICA), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) are widely used for the elimination of OAs but these techniques require multi channel EEG signals for processing.

This work filters the data of a single subject into five frequency bands and calculates the microstate topographic maps of EEG signals in different frequency bands, respectively. The extracted features of microstate classes are coverage, duration, occurrence, and transition probability between microstates.

Pilots rely on prospective memory to remember to complete planned (future) tasks while flying. Yet, prospective memory is particularly vulnerable to sleep debt because of its reliance on a network of mental processes, such as the detection of details from the environment needed to “cue” the task. Therefore, pilots assume high risk for prospective memory failures due to their accumulation of sleep debt arising from work schedules and circadian disruptions associated with frequent time-zone changes. Because of its ability to sense rapid changes in brain activity non-obtrusively, wireless encephalography was used to investigate the effects of sleep debt on scalp electrical potentials and spectral power time-locked to prospective memory responses. During simulated automated flight segments 36 non-pilots completed a series of prospective memory tasks. Event-related potentials and spectral perturbation associated with the prospective memory responses showed that those with sleep debt accumulated over the previous week had weaker monitoring activity prior to the response, and excessive neural activity after the response. These results show the application of wireless sensors located on the scalp over the frontal lobes were sufficient to measure sleep debt related inefficiency in brain activity associated with prospective memory during automated flight.","","979-8-3503-2307-8","10.1109/SAS58821.2023.10254049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254049","electroencephalography;wireless sensors;prospective memory;aviation","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Sleep;Current measurement;Neural activity;Scalp;Electroencephalography","","","","36","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve the performance and reliability of EEG sensors in real-life settings, we propose a method to evaluate the quality of EEG signals, based on which users can easily adjust the connection between electrodes and their skin. Our method helps to filter invalid EEG data from personal trials in both domestic and office settings. We then apply an algorithm based on Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) which has been designed to remove ocular artifacts (OA) from the EEG signal. DWT is applied to obtain a reconstructed OA signal as a reference while ANC, based on recursive least squares, is used to remove the OA from the original EEG data. The newly produced sensors were tested and deployed within the OPTIMI framework for chronic stress detection. EEG nonlinear dynamics features and frontal asymmetry of theta, alpha, and beta bands have been selected as biological indicators for chronic stress, showing relative greater right anterior EEG data activity in stressful individuals.

One of the issues during this time is a mental stress disorder. Stress burdens the students either through mental or physical capabilities. The common method of determining stress includes physical examination and clinical diagnosis. However, the method is subjective and time-consuming as doctors need to make sure that their diagnosis is accurate. Thus, the severity of the stress stages could not be easily determined. A new method using machine learning-based algorithms coupled with EEG devices promises to overcome the issues with the current approaches. This paper presents an investigation using machine learning techniques based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which allows for the reduction in the dimensionality of datasets to enhance their interpretability while minimizing information loss. The pre-processed EEG data and PCA-based EEG data were compared and analyzed using three machine learning classifiers such as K-Nearest Network (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results indicate that KNN demonstrated the highest average classification accuracy of 99%, while the other approaches mentioned above averaged around 50% and 80% for NB and MLP respectively.

EEG would in many circumstances be the preferred technique for analysing brain activity, as it is less expensive and more practical to use than other modalities like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), notably due to its size. However, its spatial resolution is limited, hampering its ability to characterise activity across spatially distributed brain networks. In comparison, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers very good spatial resolution but the haemodynamic nature of the signal limits its temporal resolution to the order of seconds. A possible solution to this problem is to use both EEG and fMRI signals, but this approach would lead to the loss of convenience of EEG alone. We would like to bring in the advantages of fMRI signal into EEG assessment of brain state and brain responses without the necessity for the presence of the fMRI equipment on site.

The competitive ANN, often described as a winner takes all neural structure, is based on dynamic competition among the net neurons where learning takes place only with the winning neuron. Using a simple single-layered structure, the proposed scheme results in convergence of the actual neural weights to the embedded ERP patterns.

Three time windows, P2 (125-230ms), EPN (120-200ms) and P3 (300-650ms) were obtained and differences in amplitude and latencies were analyzed. A higher P2 amplitude and a remarkable decrease on P3 amplitude were observed at the visual cortex. The spectral power analysis shows a higher reactivity of alpha band than theta and beta bands. Nonetheless, we found a remarkable decrease in beta power for the given condition. However, beta and theta band showed a spectral change appeared laterally. As enlightened by different scholars, alpha oscillations are associated with the top-down control of visual cortex and play an important role for perception and involved in information processing during periodic cycle of the sensory information.","","978-1-7281-1708-9","10.1109/ICSPCC46631.2019.8960831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8960831","Alpha oscillation;Early Posterior Negativity (EPN);Emotion;Event-related potential (ERP);Visual stimuli","","","4","","15","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, estimating the degree of circadian rhythm disturbance is important for discriminating psychiatric disorders from healthy conditions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) allows to detect brain activity directly, but the recorded signal combines neural activity across multiple time scales. The complexity of brain activity across multiple time scales has been previously quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis. In this study, we investigated whether MSE analysis of EEG data can detect circadian rhythms. Our results show that in the daytime, the complexity of brain activity is increased at larger temporal scale, and that MSE analysis detects these changes more accurately than conventional power analysis. Because complexity at large temporal scales arises from the long-range connectivity in brain networks, we suggest that the decrease in this EEG pattern complexity by night is mediated by melatonin, which suppresses neural firing and reduces wide-range interactions between brain regions. Our method can be applied for the EEG-based analysis of circadian rhythms in longitudinal studies and may help to diagnose healthy states and psychiatric conditions.","","978-1-6654-2119-5","10.1109/ICCICC53683.2021.9811332","Kayamori Foundation of Informational Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811332","Circadian Rhythm;Complexity Analysis;Electroencephalography;EEG Signals;Multiscale entropy","Pathology;Firing;Neural activity;Estimation;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Circadian rhythm","","2","","36","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, two-layer LSTM combined with a self-attention model is utilized to extract temporal representations of different EEG slices.

Therefore, in the present work, we examined the following methodologies in terms of obtaining individual motor-related EEG spectral peaks: fast Fourier Transform analysis, power spectrum density analysis, wavelet analysis, and a principal component based time-frequency analysis. We used EEG data obtained when performing two different motor tasks – a hand grip task and a hand opening- and-closing task. Our results showed that both the motor task type and the specific method for performing the analysis had considerable impact on the extraction of subject-specific oscillation spectral peaks.Clinical Relevance—This exploratory study provides insights into the potential effects of using different methods to extract individual brain oscillations, which is important for designing personalized brain-machine-interfaces.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340684","Nature; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340684","","Wavelet transforms;Time-frequency analysis;Fast Fourier transforms;Wavelet analysis;Electroencephalography;Biology;Recording","Electroencephalography;Hand Strength;Brain;Brain Waves;Brain Mapping","","","15","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Dynamic Channel Selection Strategy for Dense-Array ERP Classification","S. Kota; L. Gupta; D. L. Molfese; R.

The challenge is to exploit the enhanced spatial information offered by dense arrays while overcoming the significant increase in the dimensionality problem introduced by the large increase in the number of channels. These conflicting objectives are achieved by introducing a spatiotemporal-array model to observe the dense-array ERP amplitude variations across channels and time, simultaneously. To account for latency variations and EEG noise in the array elements, each spatiotemporal element in the array is initially modeled as a Gaussian random variable. A two-step process that uses the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test and the Lilliefors test is formulated to select the array elements that have different Gaussian densities across all ERP categories. Selecting spatiotemporal elements that fit the assumed model and also statistically differ across the ERP categories not only ensures high classification accuracies but also decreases the dimensionality significantly. The selection is dynamic in the sense that selecting spatiotemporal-array elements corresponds to selecting ERP samples of different channels at different time instants. Each selected array element is classified using a univariate Gaussian classifier, and the resulting decisions are fused into a decision fusion vector that is classified using a discrete Bayes classifier. By converting an inherently multivariate classification problem into a simpler problem involving only univariate classifications, the dimensionality problem that plagues the design of practical multivariate ERP classifiers is circumvented. Consequently, classifiers can be designed to classify the ERPs that are unique to an individual without having to collect a prohibitively large ERP dataset from him/her. The application of the resulting dynamic-channel-selection-based classification strategy is demonstrated by designing and testing classifiers for eight subjects using ERPs from a Stroop color test and it is shown that the strategy yields high classification accuracies. Finally, it is noted that because of the generalized formulation of the strategy, it can be applied to various other problems involving the classification of multivariate signals acquired from multiple identical or multiple heterogeneous sensors.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2006985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663622","Decision fusion;dense electrode arrays;dimensionality reduction;dynamic channel selection;event-related potentials (ERPs);spatiotemporal modeling","Enterprise resource planning;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Testing;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Delay;Gaussian noise;Random variables;Birth disorders","Bayes Theorem;Evoked Potentials;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","10","","45","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EEG signals were collected from 4 healthy volunteers during imagination of six tasks that involved three limbs (left and right index fingers and right toes ) and two speeds (fast and slow) and each task repeated 40 times in random order. In a single trial, periodic fast or slow motor imagination was executed. EOG and EMG signals are eliminated by independent component analysis (ICA). Time/frequency analysis is applied to characterize mean event-related changes in the power spectrum during single trials across subjects. Grand average event-related potentials (ERPs) is filtered 2Hz cut-off frequency by IIR filter to extract slow potentials and compared between fast and slow. The distinctive frequency bands and time ranges for significant changes in power related to motor imagination at different speeds and different limbs are found in the paper. Periodic slow motor imagination may invoke more positive slow potentials than fast motor imagination and fast movement imagination reaches at maximum positive peak more quickly than slow movement imagination. Executing periodic fast and slow motor imagination of left and right index fingers and right toes during a single trial is a new mental control strategy paradigm for human-machine interface.

In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a rather expensive brain recording tool with high spatial and poor temporal resolution. In this study, we aim at recovering the brain activity (source localization and activity-intensity) with high spatial resolution using only EEG recordings. Each EEG electrode records a linear combination of the activities of various parts of the brain. As a result, a multi-electrode EEG recording represents the brain activities via a linear mixing matrix. Due to distance attenuation, this matrix is almost sparse. Using simultaneous recordings of fMRI and EEG, we estimate the mixing matrix (calibration). Since Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI is a measure of energy used by active brain region, it has a quadratic relation with the electric potential waveform emitted from each fMRI volume pixel (voxel). Assuming uncorrelated time series from different regions, we reformulate the (underdetermined) forward problem as a linear problem and solve it using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) method. Besides the mixing matrix, the brain activities are often sparse spatially. Thus, we employ the estimated mixing matrix to extract the activity intensity of various brain regions from EEG recordings using iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA). We verify the proposed method on synthetic data. In particular, we divide the gray matter of the brain into 300 regions and assume a 30%-sparse measurement matrix, as well as 5% of regions to be active simultaneously. Simulations results show 88% accuracy in localizing the sources and and 66% accuracy in activity intensity estimation.","","978-1-7281-3741-4","10.1109/SampTA45681.2019.9030998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9030998","Electroencephalogram;Blood Oxygen Level Dependency;Voxels;Gray matter;Orthogonal Matching Pursuit;Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm","Electroencephalography;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Sparse matrices;Electrodes;Spatial resolution;Brain;Inverse problems","","1","","5","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to obtain an adequately performance of the nonlinear state equation, the parameters of the non-linear model are also estimated by using a multivariate non-linear least squares estimator resulting in an adaptive non-linear observer. Considering the complexity of the model and the large amount of states to be estimated, an iterative solution of the non-linear adaptive observer is proposed based on an IRA-L2 representation with spatial basis. A comparison of the performance of the algorithm in terms of relative error is analyzed, and also the evolution of the parameters is considered.

Our findings posit that P1 component in the occipital cortex has significantly increased in amplitude for 3D condition without vertical disparity compared to the 2D condition. According to previous studies, this component increases when depth information are added to the stimulus which is in line with our findings. However the amplitude of this component has significantly decreased for 3D condition with maximum vertical disparity compared to the 3D condition without vertical disparity. We have concluded that the perception of stereoscopic depth by subjects have decreased in this case due to the distortion introduced by vertical disparity.

Recent studies show that observers can pay attention to an invisible stimulus (unconscious), and that a stimulus can be clearly seen in the absence of attention. We used a novel psychophysics task to explore the neural correlates of top-down attention and consciousness. Method: The task is meant to confirm that these two processes are independent from one another. EEG were recorded during the task from 45 subjects in occipital, Parietal and frontal lobes. Target-locked ERPs for masked and unmasked condition were constructed. Time features corresponding to P100, ,200 and P300 components (i.e. correlate candidates of consciousness and attention) were extracted for all eight channels separately. Results: The results indicate that some of the mentioned components are increased when attention or consciousness occurs. By comparing difference waves in each condition separably, we found that increase in positivity in P100 window is the only ERP correlate of consciousness and decrease in negativity in N100,200 window and increase in positivity in P300 window are ERP correlates of attention in O1, O2, PO7 and PO8 which are relevant channels. Conclusions: Our task could separate attention and consciousness successfully through their neural correlates. Our results introduce new ERP correlates of attention and consciousness. The results also suggest that these ERP components are meaningful features for the distinction between these two concepts. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these correlates of consciousness and specially attention are introduced in separable method.","","978-1-4673-3130-2","10.1109/ICBME.2012.6519704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519704","attention;consciousness;ERP;psychophysics","","","4","","21","IEEE","27 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study proposed a neurofeedback protocol based on personalized music selection and used three stress scales and two cognitive behavioral experiments to evaluate the stress regulation effect, and combined electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate analysis to explore the stress relief mechanism. Five university students participated in a five-session neurofeedback training. After the intervention, the results of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Stroop task showed a significant decrease in the scores of stress-related symptoms and a significant improvement in response inhibition. The EEG results showed that the absolute power of the a band in the frontal and temporal lobes increased significantly, the coverage and duration of microstate C decreased significantly, and the duration of microstate D increased significantly, which was significantly correlated with the reduction of stress scores.

Therefore, the competency of the pilot dealing with unexpected abnormal events needs applicable evaluations. But currently, almost all studies about pilots’ competency evaluation are under expected flight conditions, while ignoring pilots’ performance under unexpected abnormal conditions. Meanwhile the existing evaluation methods are too subjective, an objective and accurate evaluation method is necessary. Compared with EMG, ECG and EOG, the EEG signals have better resolution in time domain and can reflect the emotion of the pilot well. For this reason, experiments under abnormal events have been conducted in a full flight simulator to collect EEG data of pilots. The energy characteristics of the four frequency bands of the EEG signal are extracted to construct a dataset which is sent to the algorithm for building the classifier. We finally prove that the constructed random forest classifier has the best classification effect among common EEG signal classification models with accuracy 88.5% and F1-Score 84.2%.

First, the anxiety induced by 16 healthy subjects was recorded by EMG and EEG, comprehensive features were extracted from the signals. Then the pattern recognition model fused the features of EMG and EEG, based on theories of genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and support vector machine, which was designed to anxiety assessment by adjusting the feature fusion coefficient. According to the anxiety grading standard, three anxiety states were selected as severe, moderate and mild. Using only EEG data and EMG data as the sample sets, the corresponding recognition accuracy rates are 71.54% and 67.98%. However, using EEG and EMG feature fusion data as the sample sets, the average recognition accuracy rate was 81.49%, which increased by 9.95%, 14.01% compare to using EEG or EMG data individually.

The model allows for both amplitude and latency variability in the ERP component under investigation. The extracted ERP component is constrained through a spatial filter to have minimal distance (with respect to some metric) in the temporal domain from a user-designed template component.

Optimizing the suppression of background noise can play a critical role in improving the performance of EP/ERP detection. Methods: In this study, a spatio-temporal equalization (STE) method was proposed based on the Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) model, which has been shown to suppress the spatio-temporal correlation of background noise and improve the EEG signal detection performance. Results: For practical applications, two optimization schemes based on the spatio-temporal equalization method were designed to solve two common challenges in EEG signal detection: P300 and steady state visual evoked potentials. Our results demonstrated that the STE method effectively improves recognition performance of evoked or event-related potential detection. Additionally, the STE method offers fewer parameters, lower computational complexity, and easier implementation.

Recent studies have identified speech features from ECoG and sEEG recordings; however, intelligible speech synthesis has not yet been demonstrated. Our previous work has shown speech-related patterns in intracortical recordings from dorsal (arm/hand) motor cortex that enabled discrete word/phoneme classification.

Since Goal-Conflict-Specific-Rhythmicity (GCSR) in the EEG is a sign of an anxiety-related system working, we first propose a two-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN (2-D CNN). It simulates the GCSR extraction process but with the advantages of automatic frequency band selection and functional contrast calculation optimization, thus providing more comprehensive trait anxiety predictions. Then, to generate more targeted hierarchical features from local spatio-temporal scale to global, we propose a three-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN (3-D CNN), which simultaneously integrates information in the temporal and brain-topology-related spatial dimensions. In addition, we embed Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) into our model to reveal the essential brain areas that are correlated to anxious personality. The experimental results show that the percentage variance accounted for by our three-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN is 33%, which is almost four times higher than the previous theoretically derived GCSR contrast (7%). Meanwhile, it also outperforms the 2-D model (26%) and the t-test difference between the 3-D and 2-D models is significant (t(4) = 5.4962, p = 0.0053). What's more, the reverse engineering results provide an interpretable way to understand the prediction decision-making and participants' anxiety personality. Our proposed AnxietyDecoder not only sets a new benchmark for EEG-based anxiety prediction but also reveals essential EEG components that contribute to the decision-making, and thus sheds some light on the anxiety biomarker research.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851782","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Biomarkers;Electrodes;Convolutional neural networks","","2","","22","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this work is to build a single channel EEG acquisition and monitoring system for research and education purpose. By using discrete and locally available components, a low-cost analog frontend has been developed for EEG recording at channel Fp1 (prefrontal part of brain) location which can be interfaced with PC through Arduino UNO and can be analyzed in MATLAB platform. EEG is usually very low in amplitude (i.e. uV range) and gets contaminated by noise very easily which makes it challenging to acquire a good quality signal (i.e. good SNR). The single channel EEG recording and monitoring system that is designed and implemented in hardware can be used in various application like moving mouse cursor or build a security system like Face-unlocking. This recorded data can also be helpful for students to understand EEG better for further analysis and processing. The implemented system in hardware costs less than 25 USD whereas the available EEG device price starts from 100+ USD excluding the license cost to access the raw EEG.

Therefore, how to improve the SNR and the single-trial classification accuracy has received much attention. In this study, we proposed a spatiotemporal linear discriminant analysis (STLDA) method for single-trial ERP-based depression recognition, which can obtain optimal temporal and spatial filters for ERP signals to enhance their SNR significantly and preserve the spatiotemporal characteristics of the signals for depression recognition using the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification strategy.

To prevent the consequences of stress, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to determine the degree of stress being experienced. However, prior studies on perceived stress recognition focused only on resting-state EEG, neglecting neural responses to contextual events. Our study defines context as prior stimuli influencing neural activation to present stimuli. This link is associated with perceived stress, underscoring the importance of considering past experiences in stress-related neural studies. We first utilize images and different ambient sound conditions to induce emotion transitions, creating an experimental paradigm that better captures individual differences in perceived stress with EEG signals. Then we propose a context-aware model (CAM) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the emotional label embedding enhanced Transformer encoder to model the emotional context within the EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the traditional paradigm without emotion transitions, the proposed paradigm highly improved the performance of perceived stress recognition. Furthermore, the proposed CAM outperforms the state-of-the-art models by considering the temporal context of emotion transitions and is robust to different ambient sound contexts. Continuing research in this direction can deepen our understanding of perceived stress and neural signals, potentially guiding the development of technology interventions for enhanced mental well-being.","","979-8-3503-2745-8","10.1109/ACIIW59127.2023.10388140","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Cornell University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388140","Perceived stress;EEG;emotion transition;context-aware model;label embedding","Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Human factors;Brain modeling;Transformers","","1","","43","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, the problems of detecting the presence of anxiety or depression using Electroencephalography (EEG) has received attention as a way to implement assistant diagnosis, and some researchers explored that there are differences in the degree of prefrontal lateralization and functional connectivity of brain networks between patients with anxiety and depression and normal people. In this paper, we proposed a new approach that combines functional connectivity of brain networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for EEG-based anxiety and depression recognition. EEG data are collected from subjects consisting ten healthy controls and ten patients with anxiety or depression. In this way, we achieved 67.67% classification accuracy.

This research becomes very interesting because the EEG signal is complex and always changes depending on the condition of the individual at that time. So, if the information in the EEG signal can be extracted, a person’s emotional state (which tends to be hidden) will be revealed. Therefore, this study directly proposes an automatic emotion recognition system with recorded EEG data. In this study, EEG recording was performed on 32 participants. Raw EEG data is processed by stages such as pre-processing, subband decomposition, feature extraction, and classification of emotions based on feature values. The EEG signal features explored include mean value, MAV, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, zerocrossing rate, and median. Based on the results of EEG feature extraction, it can be seen that positive-negative emotions have different feature values and the differences are also significant. The results of signal feature extraction are presented based on channels (FP1, FP2, F7, and F8) and EEG subbands (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) for each emotional state (positive-negative). In addition, the best accuracy values for emotion classification are 93.75% (RNN), 93.75% (LSTM), and 92.97% (Bi-LSTM) in the classifier testing process.","","978-1-6654-5564-0","10.1109/ISMODE56940.2022.10180969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10180969","EEG Emotion Recognition;EEG Extraction Features;RNN;LSTM;Bi-LSTM","Seminars;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Market research;Electroencephalography;Recording;Data mining","","7","","18","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To meet these conditions, the therapist needs to evaluate the patient's responses in the previous sessions to define the content of the subsequent sessions. Therefore, we intend to use the psycho-physiological responses from the participants during the sessions through peripheral (i.e. ECG, EDA, EMG) and central nervous system responses (i.e. EEG) associated with emotional expression, as well as the participatory input to a visual analog scale (i.e. tactile feedback input system, avoiding huge hands movements and interruptions during carrying session) as an indicator of the subjective experience of emotions during the session (i.e. figures with different moods). This data will be also used to define the contents of each session, through a decision algorithm based on the history of the previous sessions for the same individual. All data resulting from this application will be recorded in a database to create individual reports on the session outcomes.

In this study, we propose utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) signals with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify four mental states: rest, control-alert, stress and stress mitigation. The mental stress state was induced using Stroop color word test (SCWT) with time constrains and was then mitigated using 16 Hz Binaural beat stimulation (BBs). We quantified the four mental states using the reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, subjective score, and functional connectivity images of EEG estimated by Phase Locking Value (PLV). Our results show that, the SCWT reduced the accuracy of target detection by 70% with (F= 24.56, p = .00001), and the BBs improved the accuracy by 28% (F= 4.54, p = .00470). The functional connectivity network showed different patterns between the frontal/occipital and parietal regions, under the four mental states. The proposed CNNs with PLV images differentiated between the four mental states with highest classification performance at beta frequency band with 80.95% accuracy, 80.36% sensitivity, 94.75% specificity, 83.63% precision and 81.96% F-score.

Different from the questionnaires, the EEG-based evaluation tools allow the recognition of emotions, workload, and stress with different temporal resolutions during the task performance by subjects. The results showed that 50-minute training could be enough for the ATCOs to learn the new display setting as they had relatively low stress and workload.

Emotiv EPOC X 14 channel EEG headset is utilised for the EEG collection, and ten subjects are involved in the experiment. EEG preprocessing of the collected EEG data is done using the EEGLAB toolbox in Matlab. EEG feature extraction is performed using Matlab, and feature selection and classification model training is done using the Classification Learner app in Matlab. ANOVA and ReliefF are employed as the feature selection algorithms, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes classifiers are utilised for the emotion classification. The outcomes reveal that the highest mean accuracy of 95% is achieved from the Coarse Gaussian SVM classifier, while the lowest mean accuracy of 85% is obtained from the Fine Gaussian SVM classifier detecting the calm, fear, sad, and anger emotional states. In addition, all the other trained classifier models have an accuracy between 85% and 95%.

To improve AD diagnosis, this study explores a novel approach using electroencephalography (EEG) during the encoding stage of working memory. It focuses on the excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as potential markers for AD detection. AD involves tau-mediated neuronal inhibition, impacting brain activity during cognitive tasks. Cognitive decline in AD is linked to pathological changes reflected in the E/I balance. EEG captures brain activity during memory encoding, potentially revealing AD-specific patterns. Previous studies have explored brain activity alterations in AD during encoding, this study goes further by investigating the complexity of electrical activity using DFA and reflecting the neural state utilizing E/I. EEG data is collected from AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC) groups while performing a working memory task. The encoding stage data for each group is analyzed using DFA and E/I measures at different frequency bands. The increased long-range temporal correlation in AD compared to MCI and HC suggests altered temporal dynamics in AD during encoding. The lower E/I values in AD, followed by MCI and HC, indicate reduced neural activity during encoding with increasing AD severity. This preliminary study suggests that the EEG-based E/I measure and DFA analysis during working memory encoding show potential for distinguishing AD, MCI, and HC subjects. This approach provides valuable insights for potential AD prediction and stage discrimination by capturing altered neural activity and complex brain dynamics.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9361-7","10.23919/EUSIPCO63174.2024.10715308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715308","EEG;Alzheimer's Disease (AD);encoding;detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA);excitation-inhibition ratio (E/I);Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)","Fluctuations;Atmospheric measurements;Neural activity;Time series analysis;Particle measurements;Encoding;Electroencephalography;Frequency measurement;Complexity theory;Alzheimer's disease","","","","34","","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we built a framework to understand the temporal (when in time) characteristics of speech evoked responses that differentiate prototypical vowels (true phonetic categories) from ambiguous ones (lacking a clear phonetic identity). We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from in young, healthy adults as they rapidly classified speech sounds along an acoustic-phonetic continuum. Source derived response features were submitted to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Whole-brain data provided the best decoding of prototypical from ambiguous speech with an accuracy of 95.16% [area under the curve (AUC) 95.14%; F1-score 95.00%] at 120 ms. Separate analyses using left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) data showed that LH activity was a better predictor of speech categorization as compared to RH (89.03 % vs. 86.45% accuracy). Notably, CP was decoded less robustly and later in time using hemisphere-specific data compared to whole-brain data. Our results are consistent with notions that the early ERPs (e.g., P2) are sensitive to CP and the general dominance of LH in auditory-linguistic processing.","2642-6102","978-1-7281-7366-5","10.1109/TENSYMP50017.2020.9230856","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01DC016267); University of Memphis; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9230856","EEG;categorical perception (CP);event-related potentials (ERPs);reaction time;latency;support vector machine (SVM)","Support vector machines;Decoding;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Speech processing;Kernel;Task analysis","","7","","25","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The motivational attention to food and non-food images were assessed in frontal, centroparietal, parietooccipital and occipitotemporal areas of the brain. Participants showed increased late positive potential (late ERP component) to high caloric image in the occipitotemporal region compared to low caloric and non-food images. Similar effects could be seen in the early ERP component in the frontal region, but with reversed polarity.

Brainwave signals, heart rate and keyboard-mouse activity were also collected for analyzing the potential of automatically detecting horror-related affect. Results indicated that players were more likely to experience fear from a scary event when they were in a suspense state compared to when they were in a neutral state. In this state, players only experienced fear after experiencing surprise. Heart rate data gave the best result in classifying player affect, which achieved up to 90% overall accuracy.

The time-locked measure of the EEG to the external stimuli is known as Event-Related Potential (ERP). ERP has the ability to observe human brain activities in real-time and it can help to elucidate the responses of the human brain to stimuli. However, EEG is an irregular combination of neural and non-neural sources of activities, and these non-neural (non-EEG) sources of activities are known as artifacts. Artifacts of mixed signals may degrade the quality of EEG signals by decreasing SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and may lead to erroneous conclusions in the ERP study. The main goal of this research is to record and analyze clean EEG data so that the experimental results are valid and statistically significant. This project addresses this aim by introducing a machine learning algorithm (MLA) that can screen EEG/ERP data, detect unfocused or artifacts mixed data epochs and then remove those data epochs from the signal. Overall, five types of unsupervised MLA are applied to detect unfocused ERP epochs and among them, the DBScan method shows the best performance with an artifact detection efficiency of 92%. In addition to being efficient, this MLA is also very time effective. Finally, the success of this study will allow ERP to be used as a biomarker in real-world applications.","","978-1-6654-8462-6","10.1109/CIBCB55180.2022.9863055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9863055","Electroencephalography (EEG);Event-Related Potential (ERP);Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) artifacts;unfocused epochs;detection","Electric potential;Brain;Machine learning algorithms;Forestry;Electroencephalography;Hardware;Real-time systems","","1","","33","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Offline analyses were based on event-related potential data from 21 participants performing a standard auditory oddball task and an automatic artifactual component classifier method (MARA). As a pre-processing step for ICA, high-pass filtering between 1-2 Hz consistently produced good results in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), single-trial classification accuracy and the percentage of `near-dipolar' ICA components.

Commercial EEG headsets often lead to a space-required or cost-expensive setup for obtaining simultaneous recordings of multiple subjects. The sparsity or immobility of their electrode placements may compromise their realistic applicability. Thus, this work developed a cost-efficient, portable, and customizable system to mitigate these constraints. The developed system implemented two core hardware infrastructures, including an event broadcaster and a dry electrode-compatible EEG amplifier by assembling entirely low-cost, off-the-shelf electronic components. The broadcaster allowed distribution of event markers to multiple EEG amplifiers concurrently, whereas the amplifier transmitted the digitized, event-synchronized EEG signals wirelessly. By conducting an oddball event-related potential (ERP) experiment with simultaneous recordings of three subjects on 10 days, the system reliably captured the time- and phase-locked ERP components (e.g., N100 and P300 amplitudes) by single-subject, multi-subject, and multi-day analytical approaches. The practicality and stability of the proposed system was empirically demonstrated in terms of the signal quality, EEG-event synchronization, and inter-amplifier coordination for a multi-subject setup. This work sheds light on how to economically facilitate and scale up multi-subject EEG computing for fundamental research and for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in a larger subject population.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914088","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 106-2628-E-110-002-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703054","Brain-computer interface;electroencephalogram;event-related potential;multi-subject recording","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Hardware;Synchronization;Radio frequency;Headphones;Three-dimensional displays","","12","","50","OAPA","30 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional detection methods often rely on subjective self-reports, that can be stigmatized. In this study, we developed an electroencephalography (EEG)-based system to offer a more objective approach to chronic stress assessment. Fourteen participants (aged 24–35) were evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS), with EEG data collected during resting and cognitive tasks (i.e., the Stroop color word test). The study aimed to identify the most effective brain regions and EEG features for chronic stress detection. Data analysis involved feature extraction, normalization, classification, and regression to build and assess detection models. The results indicated no significant differences among resting state, cognitive task, and perturbation signals in the classification of chronic stress levels. Resting-state signals were more effective, with logistic regression, support vector machine classifier (i.e., SVC), and random forest classifiers achieving accuracies of 93.35%, 93.26%, and 94.69%, respectively. Furthermore, the EEG-based regression models estimated PSS and TICS scores with high accuracy, with adjusted R2 values exceeding 0.90, particularly for PSS. Contributive EEG features for chronic stress detection included gamma in the frontal, central, and parietal regions, as well as beta in the frontal and parietal regions. Limitations related to the sample size and circadian rhythm control were acknowledged, suggesting the need for future research with larger samples and varied recording schedules.","2473-7607","979-8-3315-0543-1","10.1109/BMEiCON64021.2024.10896292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10896292","chronic stress;cognitive task;EEG;resting signals;Stroop color word test","Logistic regression;Accuracy;Image color analysis;Static VAr compensators;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Recording;Circadian rhythm;Stress","","1","","30","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerous studies, however, have reported contradictory and nonreplicating findings, thus the exact mapping of brain response to errors (i.e., error-related negativity [ERN]; error-related positivity [Pe]) onto specific anxiety symptoms remains unclear. In this study, we collected 16 self-reported scores of anxiety dimensions and obtained spatial features of EEG recordings from 171 individuals. We then used machine learning to (1) identify symptoms that are central for elevated ERN/Pe and (2) estimate the generalizability of traditional statistical approaches. ERN was associated with rumination, threat overestimation, and inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty. Pe was associated with rumination, prospective intolerance of uncertainty, and behavioral inhibition. Our findings emphasize that not only the amplitude of ERN but also other sources of brain signal variance encode information relevant to individual differences in error processing. The results of the generalizability check reveal the need for a change in result-validation methods to move toward robust findings that reflect stable individual differences and clinically useful biomarkers.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of stress in human-machine tasks and assessment methods based on physiological indicators remain fundamental challenges. In this paper, we employ a virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control experiment to explore the reorganization of functional brain network patterns under stress conditions. The results indicate enhanced functional connectivity in the frontal theta band and central beta band, as well as reduced functional connectivity in the left parieto-occipital alpha band, which is associated with increased mental stress. Evaluation of network metrics reveals that decreased global efficiency in the theta and beta bands is linked to elevated stress levels. Subsequently, inspired by the frequency-specific patterns in the stress brain network, a cross-band graph convolutional network (CBGCN) model is constructed for mental stress brain state recognition. The proposed method captures the spatial-frequency topological relationships of cross-band brain networks through multiple branches, with the aim of integrating complex dynamic patterns hidden in the brain network and learning discriminative cognitive features. Experimental results demonstrate that the neuro-inspired CBGCN model improves classification performance and enhances model interpretability.

Lack of sleep and poor sleep quality impair daily cognitive functions and health. While stress has been recognized as a detrimental factor on sleep quality, the relationship between pre-sleep stress level, resting EEG and subsequent sleep structure remains to be explored. This study presents a novel approach that evaluates pre-sleep stress levels using a 2-channel EEG to predict slow-wave sleep (SWS) deficiency. We recorded forehead EEG immediately before sleep onset, then utilized power spectra and entropy analysis to extract stress-related neurological features, including beta/delta correlation, alpha asymmetry, fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn), and spectral entropy (SpEn). We found that individuals with SWS deficiency exhibited signs of stress, such as a robust beta/delta correlation, higher alpha asymmetry, and increased FuzzEn. Conversely, individuals with ample SWS displayed weak beta/delta correlation and reduced FuzzEn in EEG recordings. Finally, we tested the robustness of the selected neuro markers with two supervised learning models and found that the selected markers predict SWS deficiency with an accuracy above 70%. Our study demonstrated that stress-related neurological markers derived from pre-sleep EEG can effectively predict SWS deficiency. The proposed method can be integrated with a portable EEG device and sleep-improving interventions to develop a personalized sleep-improvement solution.","","978-1-6654-1020-5","10.1109/SMC54092.2024.10831398","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:MOST 110-2321-B-A49-003,NSTC 112-2926-I-A49-505-G,113-2628-E-A49-019); Kaohsiung Medical University(grant numbers:NCTUKMU108-BIO-07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10831398","","Correlation;Forehead;Sleep;Supervised learning;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Forecasting;Stress","","","","43","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the modalities, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) were found to be the most used in assessing mental stress in the workplace. Nevertheless, these modalities are sensitive to motion artifacts and are difficult to be integrated into real work environments. To further improve stress level assessment in the workplace, multimodality integration with a reduced number of sensors such as EEG, GSR and Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be utilized. This would lead to developing strategies for stress management in real-time. Furthermore, combining EEG with fNIRS would improve source localization of mental stress.

The paper proposed a new ERP extraction algorithm using radial basis function (RBF) neural network. It discussed the configuration, learning and running of the designed network. In order to reduce computational complexity and the influence of noise in estimating ERP, the partial least square regression was introduced to train the RBF network.

As a result, one would have problems in the transition from one job to another. However, for some people rely on their brain to deal with many things and it may lead to fatigue.

The features were computed in time-frequency domain using wavelet decomposition and they were extracted from single-channel EEG signal during and before a mental arithmetic task. The amplitude, power, and frequency of extracted decomposed signals changed significantly during mental stress compared to the state before the mental arithmetic task. 12 state-of-art statistical features were computed from each decomposed signal (5 decomposed frequency bands gave a total of 60 features) of a fixed window of 10 seconds. The Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) feature selection method was used to find the most significant features, which resulted in the discovery of four features. Finally, mental stress was classified using the selected four features and Ensemble Subspace KNN classifier.

Despite the significant progress in the field, the variability in neural data remains one of the most critical challenges in constructing accurate predictive models of human intention. As a result, the majority of the previous studies have focused either on devising subject-specific signal processing and machine learning algorithms, used some data from a target user to update and calibrate a pretrained classifier, or have used data collected from a relatively large number of training subjects to construct generic classifiers for new subjects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using a relatively small number of training subjects to achieve subject-independent classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) in P300-based BCIs. To this end, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) for model selection; that is to say, for tuning CNN hyperparameters including number of layers, filters, kernel size, and epoch. The utility of the proposed model selection is warranted because LOSO-CV simulates the effect of subject-independent classification within the training data. The entire process of training (including model selection) is validated by applying another LOSO-CV external to the training process. Our empirical results obtained on four publicly available datasets confirm the capability of LOSO-CV model selection with CNN to capture intrinsic ERP features from a small group of subjects to classify observations collected from unseen subjects.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2022.3189576","Nazarbayev University Faculty Development Competitive Research(grant numbers:021220FD1151,021220FD2051); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837440","Brain–computer interfaces;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning;event-related potentials;model selection;p300;subject-independent classification","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Training;Electrodes;Kernel;Data models;Tensors","","10","","72","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The result showed that non-stress attention and stress attention level means are highly correlation. The correlation between EEG power spectrum and attention level critical value was 0.279, and the alpha and beta bands were weakly correlated with the attention level. However, there was a positive relationship between the EEG spectrum (low alpha, high alpha, low beta and high beta) with the attention level of the female brainwave, and high beta of female brainwave is statistically significant with the attention level.

EEG data were collected from 40 participants (26 males, 14 females) using a 32-channel Emotiv Epoc Flex headset, sampled at 128 Hz. The participants engaged in stress-inducing arithmetic problems, Stroop tests, and mirror image identification. These tasks were designed to create varying levels of mental stress, which were essential for analyzing the effectiveness of filtering techniques in noise reduction and signal preservation. The effectiveness of each filter was assessed based on performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the reduction in Standard Deviation (STD) and Variance (VAR). The Kalman Smoother gave a moderate performance: an MSE of 1122.07, MAE of 21.43, RMSE of 31.94, and noise reduction of 13.4% in STD and 62.72% in VAR. Also, the Savitzky-Golay filter performed moderately, which slightly underperformed in comparison with the Kalman filter. The Median filter shows high accuracy of the signal with low values of MSE, MAE, and RMSE; notwithstanding, it has low noise reduction, as can be viewed by low STD and VAR reduction. The Fixed Lag filter is very good in noise reduction, reducing STD and VAR significantly, while incurring higher errors with increased MSE, MAE, and RMSE. These findings suggest that the Kalman filter is effective for noise reduction, excessive smoothing may remove essential signal information, potentially impacting detection accuracy. Future research could explore adaptive filtering that dynamically balance noise reduction and signal preservation, thereby enhancing EEG-based mental health assessments.","","979-8-3315-0857-9","10.1109/BTS-I2C63534.2024.10942088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10942088","EEG Signal Processing;Mental Stress Detection;Kalman Filter;Savitzky-Golay Filter;Median Filter;Fixed Lag Smoother;Noise Reduction;MSE;MAE;RMSE;Standard Deviation;Variance","Measurement;Reactive power;Accuracy;Smoothing methods;Noise reduction;Mental health;Electroencephalography;Kalman filters;Mirrors;Standards","","","","26","IEEE","1 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing methods for driver status detection rarely use the rich physiological information in EEG to improve detection performance. Moreover, there is currently a lack of EEG datasets for abnormal states of train drivers. To address these gaps, we propose a novel transfer learning model based on a hybrid attention mechanism, named hybrid attention-based transfer learning network (HATNet). We first segment the EEG signals into patches and utilize the hybrid attention module to capture local and global temporal patterns. Then, a channel-wise attention module is introduced to establish spatial representations among EEG channels. Finally, during the training process, we employ a calibration-based transfer learning strategy, which allows for adaptation to the EEG data distribution of new subjects using minimal data. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a multistimulus oddball experiment to establish a EEG dataset of abnormal states for train drivers.

Beyond the training, a technology framework is proposed to assess the fitness of construction workers (e.g. suitability of people with underlining health conditions to work under particular construction environments). The new virtual construction system consists of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) of electroencephalography (EEG) neural network to capture EEG signals of users during the virtual simulation training continuously to achieve user profiling. For real-time assessment of the accident susceptibility of a worker under various construction environments, a deep learning neural network is trained to process the EEG crops and a clipping training algorithm that classifies small segments of the EEG dataset is used to improve the computational performance of the system. Physiology data of the person during the training, i.e. blood pressure and heart rate, is also recorded. Based on the EEG data and the physiology data, a statistic model is used in the safety assessment framework to set up the risk standard. The study has tested 117 workers who were employed by the construction sites in Shanghai. People who were tested in the risk group were further underwent medical examinations for risk related medical conditions that deemed unsuitable for working in construction sites. Results show six of the nine workers identified by the VR system have been medically confirmed unsuitable, thus, over 80% accuracy of our virtual reality training and assessment system.

In this article, we examine Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of electroencephalography (EEG) as a framework to evaluate how the neural representation of multifeatured haptic cues changes with association training. We focus on the first phase of cross-modal associative learning, perception of multimodal cues. A participant learned to map phonemes to multimodal haptic cues, and EEG data were acquired before and after training to create neural representational spaces that were compared to theoretical models. Our perceptual model showed better correlations to the neural representational space before training, while the feature-based model showed better correlations with the post-training data. These results suggest that training may lead to a sharpening of the sensory response to haptic cues.

To handle this problem, a number of artifact removal methods has been proposed. Specifically, we focus on a method using a multi-channel Wiener filters based on a probabilistic generative model. This method assumes that the observed signal is the sum of multiple signals elicited by psychological or physical events, and separates the observed signal into each event signal using estimated model parameters. Based on this scheme, we have proposed a model parameter estimation method using prior information of each event signal. In this paper, we examine the potential of this model to deal with highly contaminated signals by collecting EEG data intentionally contaminated by eye blinks and relatively clean ERP data, and using them as prior information of each event signal. We conducted an experimental evaluation using a classical attention task. The results showed the proposed method effectively enhances the target ERP component while reducing the contamination caused by eye blinks.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318967","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Time-frequency analysis;Probabilistic logic;Covariance matrices;Mathematical model;Electrodes","Artifacts;Blinking;Electroencephalography;Eye Movements;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","1","","12","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies suggest that personally tailored music can have a positive impact on reducing stress levels. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate personalized music by combining brain activation analysis and musical preference analysis. The proposed method involves three main stages: (1) Source Separation, (2) Brain Activation Analysis, and (3) Personalized Music Generation. In the first stage, we use a variant of the Wave-U-Net to decompose the input song into its vocals and melodies. Subsequently, we employ electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze the user’s brain activation and identify preferred segments. The third stage involves the generation of personalized music using a transformer-based music generation model, which takes into account the user’s music preference and brain activation patterns. Furthermore, this approach was assessed through an experiment with 10 participants, achieving an average satisfaction level of 3.9/5 and a 52.97% increase in Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) fluctuation percentage after analyzing brain activation with the generated melody.

This paper proposed a new method of EOG correction based on Subspace Independent Components Analysis (SICA) which considers the Bi-directionality between the EOG and the EEG signal. Here, the advanced model is used to reduce the EOG artifacts from the datasets of the simulate data and the EEG dataset from BCI competition IV.

The consequence of it depends on how people handle it. Depression and anxiety are the results of mental stress, and they are the major challenges in today’s world. Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of suicide. Most of the time suicidal patients hide their true feelings and fail to communicate their psychiatric problems to physicians. The specific issues that need to be addressed are finding an easy, reliable and realistic way to diagnose mental stress to keep it from becoming a serious and irreversible condition. The primary prevention of mental stress utilizing machine learning algorithms based on reward and punishment processing is important to avoid mental diseases. Several techniques have been used to detect mental stress, and very few papers have tried to detect a patients’ comorbidity condition. However, literature shows that there are still chances of further improvement in this field. The traditional methods of detecting mental stress involve a statistical questionnaire approach with some shortcomings as results based on the traditional approach can be biased, which is not possible if Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a method to evaluate the EEG signals on thirty-two individuals for identifying comorbid patients using nine machine learning classifiers based on reward and punishment processing.

It is tremendously engaged in the early stage of information processing to accelerate attention. Several studies focused on different aspects of the psychological effect of colors, which showed that color designs induce positive emotion, increased cognitive effort, and better learning outcomes compared to achromatic stimuli. Considering the importance of our daily encounters with colored stimuli, especially the RGB, black and white, studying the effect of these stimuli on brain activities is essential. Method: We investigated the significant differences in spatiotemporal brain activity of black, white, and RGB information. We used a task in which 12 participants were presented with random black-and-white and RGB-colored stimuli in a dark room. Each stimulus was displayed on the whole screen of a CRT calibrated monitor for 10 seconds. A 64-channel EEG device was used to acquire the EEG data. Results: Our results show that for RGB-colored stimuli, the beta power of the occipito-parietal region in early period (85 - 120 ms after stimulus onset) for RGB is higher than that of black ( $p < 0.05$ ), while in late period (800 - 855 ms after stimulus onset), for RGB it is higher than that of both black and white ( $p < 0.05$ ). Moreover, the alpha power of the centro-parietal region in late period (930 - 1360 ms after stimulus onset) for RGB is higher than that of black ( $p < 0.01$ ). Finally, ITPC of alpha band in occipariatal region in the late period (840 - 920 ms after stimulus onset) for white is higher than black ( $p < 0.05$ ) and RGB ( $p < 0.01$ ). Conclusion: The results regarding brain responses to black/white and RGB stimuli, as well as beta and alpha-band differences in centro-pariatal and occipito-parietal regions provide valuable insights that can be interpretted within perception, emotional activities, and visual processes.

Diagnosing epileptic patients still stands as a challenge due to similar symptoms shown by other medical conditions such as migraines, fainting and panic attacks, often unable to be ruled as epilepsy without detecting seizure. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has proven to be the most helpful procedure for diagnosis of epilepsy. Interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), detected in EEG aids in differentiating epileptic and other nonepileptic episodes. Currently, available EEG devices are often bulky and restricted to be in use of clinical environments, limiting treatment process among epilepsy patients. The aim of this research is to present a personalized mobile EEG device for epilepsy monitoring and management. A customizable dry electrode EEG headset with 16-channel was assembled and configured. A server and an Android based mobile application were also developed to aid in remote monitoring regardless of location and available network. The device was tested and validated for signal reliability by a neurologist at the Neurology Lab of Canselor Tuanku Muhriz Hospital. The proposed device has potential to be solution for numerous limitations in current epilepsy treatment decision and may even be vital in addressing the drawback of recent pandemic.

Specifically, we examine features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal (EDA) signals from the following three datasets: Anxiety Phases Dataset (APD), Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD), and the Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion (CASE) dataset. We aim to understand whether these features are specific to anxiety or general to other high-arousal emotions through a statistical regression analysis, in addition to a within-corpus, cross-corpus, and leave-one-corpus-out cross-validation across instances of stress and arousal. We used the following classifiers: Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and an ensemble of the aforementioned models. We found that models trained on an arousal dataset perform relatively well on a previously unseen stress dataset, and vice versa.

We recorded pupil size and ERPs while participants were presented with a series of words and then asked whether the words had been in the initial list when they were later presented intermixed with unpresented words. We found that a smaller prestimulus baseline pupil size during the study phase was associated with better memory performance. Study items also evoked a larger P3 response at presentation and a greater old/new memory ERP effect at test when prestimulus pupil size was small rather than large. Prestimulus hippus power was found to be a between-subjects factor affecting the robustness of memory encoding with less power being associated with a greater old/new memory ERP effect.

The proposed prediction algorithm was tested on a data set of continuous EEG signals recorded from 24 subjects. During the EEG recordings, the subjects were asked to drive from an initial position to a destination using a city map in a simulated driving environment. The overall accuracy values for the prediction of the start and the end of map viewing were 81% and 70%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can predict the start and end of map viewing with relatively high accuracy and can be generalized to individual subjects. The outcome of this study has a high potential to improve the design of future intelligent navigation systems. Prediction of the start of map viewing can be used to provide route information based on a driver's needs and consequently avoid map-viewing activities. Prediction of the end of map viewing can be used to provide warnings for potential long map-viewing durations.

Therefore the contribution of this paper is a novel methodology for recognizing thought patterns based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The presented thought recognition methodology is a three step process which utilizes SOM for unsupervised clustering of pre-processed EEG data and feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification. The presented method was tested on 5 different users for identifying two thought patterns; “move forward” and “rest”. EEG Data acquisition was carried out using the Emotiv EPOC headset which is a low cost, commercial-off-the-shelf, noninvasive EEG signal measurement device.

The fuzzy clustering algorithm is the core of our method, since its fine-grained membership grades how much a sample belongs to a given cluster, making the method applicable even when groups have a certain overlap. Prior to the clustering step, we apply weights to the feature vectors, optimizing them in order to enhance the variance within the dataset, and we extract time-window-interval-based features inspired by interval arithmetic. We apply the data processing workflow to the analysis of a set of ERPs recorded during an emotional Go/NoGo task. We evaluate the performance of the unsupervised analysis by computing a measure based on the clusterization rate of trials in different experimental conditions. The results of the studied dataset show that the proposed method obtains a difference of clusterization rate of 69% in Go versus NoGo trials, when weights and interval features are applied to the data, improving previous work not including weights and interval features, which had a rate of 31%. Furthermore, when compared with the standard fuzzy c-means, our proposed possibilistic clustering algorithm outperforms it in terms of the clusterization rate. We also examine the effect of preprocessing the data with independent component analysis and removing noise-related components and observe that this does not improve significantly the obtained results. These findings demonstrate that our proposed method provides a valuable data processing workflow robust to EEG artifacts and able to produce a clustering that is coherent with the experimental conditions represented in the ERP dataset.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2910499","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:CR13I1-138032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686200","Electroencephalography (EEG);event-related potential (ERP);interval features;possibilistic clustering;unsupervised","Electroencephalography;Data processing;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Scalp","","11","","46","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EEG signal processing tends to describe and quantify these variations in such a way that they are localized in temporal, spectral and spatial domain. Here we use multi-way (Tensor) analysis for localizing the EEG events. We used EMD process for decomposing EEG into distinct oscillatory modes, which are then mapped to TF plane using the near optimal Reassigned Spectrogram. Temporal, Spatial and Spectral information of the Multichannel EEG are then used to generate a three-way Frequency-Time-Space EEG tensor. Exploiting EMD also enables us to detrend the EEG recordings. Simulation results on both synthetic and real EEG data show that tensor analysis greatly improve separation and localization of overlapping events in EEG and it could be effectively exploited for detecting and characterizing the evoked potentials.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318313","","Electroencephalography;Tensile stress;Time-frequency analysis;Brain models;Spectrogram;Yttrium","Adult;Algorithms;Brain;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","4","","17","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In current discrete clinical cognitive assessment methods used to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia, physicians see patients annually or biannually. They rely on patient's history and clinical cognitive assessments to identify changes in memory or functional ability as indications of MCI/dementia in conjunction with exclusionary tests. They are limited in these discrete assessments by their accuracy and infrequent occurrence. The episodic assessment framework proposed will allow better ongoing information about the true well-being of the patient through assessment of memory and functional cognitive ability on a weekly or even daily basis between appointments. This paper identifies features of EEG/ERP measurements during Neuropsychological Behavioral Testing that could allow the future inclusion in the framework using now available consumer EEG devices. A pilot group of 32 participants (17 healthy, 15 MCI) was studied using a 1-back test, while their brain activity was measured using EEG. Features of the ERP thus generated were identified and measured. These ERP features and associated behavioral measurements from the 1-back test were analyzed to identify features both alone and in combination that allowed the correct classification of the participants using a repeated leave-one-out train and test method. A feature pair (1-back response time and CPz correlation) was identified that provides the best two-feature performance (1 false positive/1 false negative error) with a third feature (response required - Pz P1 to N1 latency) providing additional improvement. Given these results, it is possible that episodic ERP measurements may help with cognitive impairment diagnosis in the future.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2017.2668618","Bruyère Research Institute Growth Fund; Mitacs Accelerate Program; DynamicBrain Inc.; Chartwell Retirement Residences Inc.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7870571","Electroencephalogram (EEG);event-related potentials (ERPs);mild cognitive impairment (MCI)","Electroencephalography;Cognition;Dementia;History;Electric potential;Testing","","18","","30","IEEE","3 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In pop-out condition, both color and orientation of the distractors differed from target, while in search condition they differed only in orientation. During the task, high-density EEG (256 channels) data were recorded and analyzed by means of behavioral, event-related potentials, i.e., the P300 component and brain source localization analysis using 3D-Vector Field Tomography (3D-VFT). Twenty subjects (half female; 32±4.7 years old) participated in the experiments, performing 60 trials for each condition. Behavioral analysis revealed that both female and male outperformed in the pop-out condition compared to the search one, with respect to accuracy and reaction time, whereas no gender-related statistical significant differences were found. Nevertheless, in the search condition, higher P300 amplitudes were detected for females compared to males (p <; 7 · 10-3). Moreover, the findings suggested that the maximum activation in females was located mainly in the left inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, whereas in males it was found in the right inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri.

The standardized raw EEG data is subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation; the ratio-cut is applied to preserve 99% of the explained variance. Conversely, the fMRI data is processed as single point brain activations aggregated at fMRI time resolution $\delta_{t,fMRI}$. Each set of PCA transformed EEG features is aligned with the explained brain activation. The processed data is then trained using a Polynomial Regression model of degree (d = 4). The predictive power of each of the principal component in capturing the explained brain activation is quantified in terms of Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) and Mean Squared Errors (MSEs). The recorded {MAEs, MSEs} reflect that the principal components are causally related to explained brain activations and demonstrate consistent performance over the range of principal components introduced as a result of ratio-cut method. The MAEs for each of the task i.e. {rest, sleep} are closely spaced between {0.35-0.60}; this implies that a single principal component cannot disproportionately detect brain activation(s). Moreover, the diff{MAE} is higher than diff{MSE} for higher principal components that points to prediction difficulty in sleep state-potentially driving the error values to the down-side. The proposed study bridges gaps in the existing literature by introducing new insights in multi-modal signal processing and neuroimaging. The findings in this study can be of significant importance in prediction modeling of clinically relevant data in neurological patient care pathways.","","979-8-3315-3149-2","10.1109/IDAP64064.2024.10710881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10710881","principal component analysis (pca);electroencephalography (eeg);functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri);supervised learning;signal processing;polynomial regression","Training;Sleep;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Signal processing;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models;Speech processing;Principal component analysis","","","","15","IEEE","16 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper it is attempted to fuse multi-modal physiological signals of the autonomic (skin conductance) and central nervous systems (EEG), through the use of appropriate feature extraction procedures discriminating emotional arousal modulations, to a neural network classifier. Thus, skin conductivity responses, evoked-related potential peaks, and delta frequency oscillatory patterns are analyzed for a comparatively large number of subjects exposed to different emotions, evoked by pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. The achieved neural network classifications were encouraging. It was found that fear was successfully differentiated (100%), pleasant emotions differing in their arousal level were well distinguished (80%), but the discrimination of low arousing negative feelings such as melancholy was more difficult (70%). It is argued that physiological patterning of multimodal recordings may successfully contribute to the enhancement of human computer interaction and emotion aware computing.","","978-1-4244-2844-1","10.1109/BIBE.2008.4696823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696823","","Delta modulation;Skin;Conductivity;Biological neural networks;Speech recognition;Humans;Motion analysis;Fuses;Central nervous system;Electroencephalography","","15","","15","IEEE","8 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, exposing the human to high levels of mental stress which he/she cannot tolerate, may affect the successful completion of the task to be accomplished. Therefore, the need for a system which can monitor the levels of the applied mental stress on human according to his/her current state is of prime importance. Hence, this work introduces a new system that can be used to automatically modify the applied mental stress according to the output of a linguistic model that employs fuzzy sets in the form of Mamdani-type fuzzy rules. This model accepts two markers which were derived based on heart rate and pupil dilation signals and predicts a performance index which is the test accuracy. Consequently, a “crisp” decision is made according to such predicted performance to alter the applied mental stress level. This system is implemented on two personal computers connected through a network; one for applying mental stress (in the form of arithmetic test), while the other is for monitoring the human mental state through the two markers and managing the mental stress levels. The results show a close match between the system's closed loop operation and the actual measurements acquired from human volunteers.","","978-1-4673-6698-4","10.1109/EAIS.2015.7368785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368785","Mental stress management;Arithmetic mental stress;pupil dilation;heart rate;Mamdani fuzzy model","Indexes;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Stress","","11","","21","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since it is already known ‘where’ in the brain language is processed, the next crucial step is to investigate ‘how’ these neuronal circuits and processes work. Thus, it is necessary to apply experimental procedures with a high temporal resolution such as electroencephalography (EEG) in order to capture and identify these mechanisms. However, EEG is highly prone to measurement errors as the surface electrodes collect all kinds of electromagnetic noise from physiological and non-physiological sources. Here, we present a procedure to remove those artifacts (with a special focus on eye artifacts) and provide evidence that it is possible to extract event related potentials (ERPs) from EEG data recorded during listening of an audio book. We developed an evaluation pipeline, tested on EEG-data of 36 participants. The pipeline consists of two major steps: spectral filtering (bandpass: 1 Hz-20 Hz) and a custom version of independent component analysis (ICA) filtering. Thus, we defined one channel (Fp1) as our electro-oculogram channel (EOG) and tested which independent components significantly correlate with this channel. All independent components that had a correlation above a fixed threshold were removed. This procedure is highly reproducible and allows to extract clean ERPs from EEG data during continuous speech perception. We show that the ERP responses to adjectives are different from ERPs to verbs in shape as well as latency. We suggest that this advancement in evaluating EEG data may further improve neurolinguistics research and is a further step to develop a unified evaluation pipeline for these kinds of data.","2831-4352","979-8-3503-3849-2","10.1109/BioSMART58455.2023.10162054","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10162054","EEG;event related potentials (ERP);continuous speech perception;independent component analysis (ICA);neurolinguistics","Measurement errors;Electrooculography;Filtering;Shape;Pipelines;Independent component analysis;Electroencephalography","","4","","24","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EEG signals are recorded using a five channel EEG headband for a duration of three minutes, with dry electrodes. In the first step, we acquire data by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire and in the second step, we record EEG using muse headband and apply linear regression algorithm. The values of the PSS score serve as ground truth, which is then predicted by linear regression model. From the results, it is shown that the value of root mean squared error is as low as 2.36. This shows that PSS scores can be predicted with considerable accuracy by applying linear regression model on EEG signals.

Over the last 20 years, various types of speller systems have been developed in brain-computer interface and EOG/eye-tracking research; however, these conventional systems have a tradeoff between the spelling accuracy (or decoding) and typing speed. Healthy users and physically challenged participants, in particular, may become exhausted quickly; thus, there is a need for a speller system with fast typing speed while retaining a high level of spelling accuracy. In this paper, we propose the first hybrid speller system that combines EEG and EOG signals with visual feedback technology so that the user and the speller system can act cooperatively for optimal decision-making. The proposed spelling system consists of a classic row-column event-related potential (ERP) speller, an EOG command detector, and visual feedback modules. First, the online ERP speller calculates classification probabilities for all candidate characters from the EEG epochs. Second, characters are sorted by their probability, and the characters with the highest probabilities are highlighted as visual feedback within the row-column spelling layout. Finally, the user can actively select the character as the target by generating an EOG command. The proposed system shows 97.6% spelling accuracy and an information transfer rate of 39.6 (±13.2) [bits/min] across 20 participants. In our extended experiment, we redesigned the visual feedback and minimized the number of channels (four channels) in order to enhance the speller performance and increase usability. Most importantly, a new weighted strategy resulted in 100% accuracy and a 57.8 (±23.6) [bits/min] information transfer rate across six participants. This paper demonstrates that the proposed system can provide a reliable communication channel for practical speller applications and may be used to supplement existing systems.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2839116","Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, through the SW Starlab Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:IITP-2015-1107); Korean Government: Development of BCI based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions using Deep Learning(grant numbers:2017-0-00451); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361842","Brain-computer interfaces (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);electrooculogram (EOG);P300 speller;visual feedback","Electrooculography;Electroencephalography;Visualization;Task analysis;Decoding;Layout","Adult;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Communication Aids for Disabled;Decision Making;Electroencephalography;Electrooculography;Event-Related Potentials, P300;Eye Movements;Feedback, Sensory;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult","131","","72","OAPA","21 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research paper presents an automated system for efficient detection of brain tumors in EEG signals using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The ANN employed in the proposed system is feedforward backpropagation neural network. Generally, the EEG signals are bound to contain an assortment of artifacts from both subject and equipment interferences along with essential information regarding abnormalities and brain activity (responses to certain stimuli). Initially, adaptive filtering is applied to remove the artifacts present in the EEG signal. Subsequently, generic features present in the EEG signal are extracted using spectral estimation. Specifically, spectral analysis is achieved by using Fast Fourier Transform that extracts the signal features buried in a wide band of noise. The clean EEG data thus obtained is used as training input to the feedforward backpropagation neural network. The trained feedforward backpropagation neural network when fed with a test EEG signal, effectively detects the presence of brain tumor in the EEG signal.

These applications need to know the personal features of users, such as their gender, to improve the user experience. Notably, therefore, it is possible to categorize gender based on speech and facial characteristics. Additionally, instead of considering body part features, gender prediction based on physiological measurements such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provides a strong and reliable method for an automatic gender classification system. EEG signals record brain activity from the outer scalp, which means they are contaminated by external and internal noise. Therefore, designing an effective gender detection mechanism based on EEG data is challenging because gender-related EEG features must be captured accurately. In this paper, we investigated the effect of emotions on a gender prediction system using EEG data in negative and positive emotional states. We proposed a model that extracts the power spectral density features of EEG signals in emotional states and predicts gender using three classifiers: decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron. Furthermore, we studied the effect of omitting a single electrode and multiple electrodes in the EEG data on the proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using emotional state EEG data to identify gender. Furthermore, the random forest classifier achieved the lowest percentage error of 7% based on negative emotion EEG signal. Finally, the results revealed that the brain’s frontal lobe has a high level of success in enabling differentiation between males and females.","","978-1-6654-3904-6","10.1109/ICSIP52628.2021.9688884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688884","Classification;gender;emotions;random forest;MLP;EEG signals","Electrodes;Frontal lobe;Biometrics (access control);Databases;Multilayer perceptrons;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","4","","25","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drawing from the cognitive model of social anxiety and attention control theory, heightened levels of social anxiety may correspond to poorer attention control ability. However, little is known about the underlying cognitive mechanisms of the relationship between social anxiety and attention control. To address this research gap, the current study recruited a sample of 156 college students (56 women) who underwent self-report measures of social anxiety, cognitive flexibility, and attention control, followed by a resting-state EEG recording. The results revealed a significant negative predictive effect of social anxiety on attention control, with cognitive flexibility partially mediating this relationship. Furthermore, resting-state theta power emerged as a significant moderator, accentuating the negative impact of social anxiety on cognitive flexibility among individuals with lower theta power. In addition, frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) demonstrated a moderating effect, with lower FAA intensifying the predictive influence of cognitive flexibility on attention control. Taken together, these results suggested that social anxiety can predict attention control either directly or indirectly via the mediating role of cognitive flexibility, and lower theta power and FAA has a risk amplification effect, which provide novel insights into the treatment and prevention of social anxiety and its negative impact on college students.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_02095","Youth Research Funding in Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2022GJ053); Graduate Research and Innovation Funding in the School of Psychology for South China Normal University(grant numbers:PSY-SCNU202112,PSY-SCNU202219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10460505","","","","","","","","5 Mar 2024","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Whilst, 19 channels of CONTEC Medical EEG System KT88-3200 have been used as the main recording devices. Based on our study, there is evidence of a correlation between the psychological state, behavior and physiological signals of Phasmophobia candidates. The EEG recording generates a different type of signature regarding the level of fear the candidates encountered. Moreover, the recitation of Ruqyah can reduce the Phasmophobia episodes and transit the candidates into calm and relaxing conditions. This will lead to an advanced method for detecting Phasmophobia episodes automatically based on EEG recognition.

The stimuli set consist of a number of self-face images and that of subject's relatives, which are expected to elicit brain activity in a subject-specific manner. The subject-specific biometric marker used in the proposed authentication system is the relative spectral activity of left and right hemisphere EEG in various frequency bands. Experimental analysis reveals utility of alpha and beta bands for the proposed approach, offering an average biometric recognition accuracy of 87.50% over 4 subjects.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was specifically tuned to optimize classification accuracy of somatosensory ERP. The network includes temporal-spatial processing layers followed by MobileNet-styled module with Squeeze-Excitation. The model was trained as subject-specific classifier.

Switching from 64 to 8-channel configuration brought only 3.2% decreased accuracy while further reducing to 4-channel did not make significant changes. Increasing the number of ERP trials used for classification improves the accuracy, which plateaued around 90% at 5-trial. In terms of implementation, the proposed model brought the classification accuracy improvement without significantly increasing the model size or inference time tested on mobile platforms.

In this work, we have proposed a framework for synthesizing the images from the brain activity recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG) using small-size EEG datasets. This brain activity is recorded from the subject’s head scalp using EEG when they ask to visualize certain classes of Objects and English characters.

Such methods might be based on alteration of brain response caused by morphine during painful stimuli. The study included 11 healthy volunteers subjectively quantifying perception of painful electrical stimulations in the esophagus. Brain evoked potentials following stimulations were recorded from sixty-four electroencephalographic channels at baseline and ninety minutes after morphine administration. Marginals obtained from discrete wavelet coefficients for each channel were used as input to an optimized support vector machine classifying between baseline and after morphine administration. The electroencephalographic channel leading to the best performance was further analyzed to identify brain alterations caused by morphine. Marginals from volunteers with no analgesic effect were examined for differences in comparison to volunteers with effect. The single-channel classification showed best performance at electrode P4 with 84.1 % of the traces classified correctly. When combining features from the 6 best performing channels, the multichannel classification increased to 92.4 %. The most discriminative feature was a decrease in the delta band (0.5 - 4 Hz) after morphine for volunteers with analgesic effect. Volunteers with no effect of morphine showed an increase in the delta band after drug administration. As only a proportion of patients benefit from opioid treatment, the new approach may help to identify non-responders and guide individualized tailored analgesic therapy.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627820","","Pain;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms;Electrodes;Support vector machines;Pattern recognition;Feature extraction","Adult;Algorithms;Analgesics, Opioid;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Morphine;Pain;Pain;Pain;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult","3","","14","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In between tasks, participants observed a black screen for about 6 s. Applying two machine-learning algorithms (Perceptron without hidden layers, and k nearest neighbors) with spectral patterns of rsEEG as input vectors, we tested the accuracy of discriminating inter-stimulus rsEEG after correctly solved tasks from rsEEG after erroneously solved tasks, as well as rsEEG after completed tasks from rsEEG after uncompleted tasks. K nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier performed better than Perceptron in recognition of rsEEG after correct versus incorrect answers (75% of accuracy rate). Both algorithms showed robust accuracy rates (more than 71%) in the detection of rsEEG after completed versus uncompleted tasks. Our findings indicate that both erroneous answers and the incompleteness of the task are reflected in the rsEEG rhythmic patterns.

By using HPM, which is a generative model for estimating underlying process that has unknown onset timing, we can estimate responses of assumed processes underlying cognitive functions and the probability distribution of the onset timing of each process. We applied HPM to ERP data obtained during the oddball task and distinguished ERPs induced by target or nontarget stimuli. We designed 2-process and 3-process HPMs and estimated the responses of each process in these HPMs. Then, we compared these responses with ERP waveforms obtained by conventional averaging. As a result, the waveforms of the estimated response from each model resembled that of averaged ERP while the peak amplitude was higher in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. In addition, the difference of the area under curve between target and nontarget condition was clearer in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. This suggests that HPM might be able to overcome the latency variability of ERP components to estimate more exact components, which will enhance differentiating ERP components between conditions in an ERP study.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9282924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282924","electroencephalography;event-related potential;hidden process model;latency variability","Conferences;Brain modeling;Probability distribution;Timing;Task analysis;Cybernetics","","","","15","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Decoding the subject’s intention from the single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) signal through a decoding algorithm is the key to RSVP-based BCI. The unavoidable noise and variability between trials in EEG signals lead to low accuracy of EEG-based RSVP detection and low universality of the model. It is necessary to develop an EEG decoding algorithm with robust generalization ability and high recognition accuracy. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end model architecture that combines multi-scale spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformers. Specifically, the multi-scale CNN is used to capture spatiotemporal features at different scales, while the Transformers are used to extract the most discriminative global information. Experimental results on the RSVP-based benchmark datasets show that the proposed method in this study can achieve higher recognition accuracy compared to the other three advanced methods in both cross-subject and within-subject experiments. The results of fine-tuning experiments using pre-trained models on a new subject show that better results can be obtained in single-subject experiments using only a small amount of data.

Several studies indicated that EEG is a robust biometric that can greatly improve identification rates. Biometric methods depending on multiple tasks are favorable than those based on a single task. Multi-tasks approaches can enhance personal recognition rates and also reduce the possibility of falsifying biometric data. Furthermore, biometric systems relying on cognitive tasks are harder to be reproduced. Therefore, this paper proposes a new EEG- biometric system based on multiple cognitive tasks. The method examines the placements of the electrodes on different sites on the scalp and selects a group of sites that influence the accuracy of the system. The results show that the proposed biometric system is capable of accurately recognizing persons. Also, the electrodes placed on frontal, temporal, and parietal sites are adequate to correctly identify persons with an identification accuracy of 100%. It has a challenging performance compared to the state of the art techniques. Thus, the proposed technique is robust and can be adopted in areas which require high security and confidentiality.","","978-1-7281-1664-8","10.1109/CSE/EUC.2019.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919556","Biometric systems, Personal identification, Security, Electroencephalogram (EEG), Machine learning","Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Scalp;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Brain","","5","","21","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The discrimination of states of mental activity specific to arithmetic calculation tasks in relation to the state specific to their absence is investigated by frequency analysis techniques of EEG signals and their classification by topological and temporal criteria. A Biosemi system with 64 electrodes and three basic scenarios for mental tasks that were applied several times to the same subject were used for data acquisition. Each EEG signal was filtered in the dedicated bands δ, θ, α, β, and Y. The results in this paper are based on the analysis of the spectral power obtained after processing the data for two specific bands case α,β. The evolution of the spectral peaks over time for all 64 recording signals provides a spatial temporal mapping of the electrical activity of the brain to identify the most relevant response channels and identify the most suitable conditions for discriminating mental states using a larger number of electrodes compared to other similar research reported..","","979-8-3503-2138-8","10.1109/ECAI58194.2023.10194141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194141","EEG signals;frequency analysis;signal clasification;mental arithmetic task","Electrodes;Time-frequency analysis;Brain;Scalp;Human factors;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems","","1","","16","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If two targets are presented in immediate succession, however, accuracy is excellent (Lag 1 sparing). The resource sharing hypothesis proposes a dynamic distribution of resources over a time span of up to 600 msec during the attentional blink. In contrast, the ST2 model argues that working memory encoding is serial during the attentional blink and that, due to joint consolidation, Lag 1 is the only case where resources are shared. Experiment 1 investigates the P3 ERP component evoked by targets in RSVP. The results suggest that, in this context, P3 amplitude is an indication of bottom–up strength rather than a measure of cognitive resource allocation. Experiment 2, employing a two-target paradigm, suggests that T1 consolidation is not affected by the presentation of T2 during the attentional blink. However, if targets are presented in immediate succession (Lag 1 sparing), they are jointly encoded into working memory. We use the ST2 model's neural network implementation, which replicates a range of behavioral results related to the attentional blink, to generate “virtual ERPs” by summing across activation traces. We compare virtual to human ERPs and show how the results suggest a serial nature of working memory encoding as implied by the ST2 model.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2009.21036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793880","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In this work a method of spatial filtering which combines DOA estimation and Beamforming techniques is presented: a DOA estimation method allows to estimate the directions of activation of the sources, while spatial filters of type Beamforming are designed to pass the electrical activity from a given direction and stop that originated from other directions.

Commuting on regular basis can be a cause of chronic stress which is linked to poor mental health, high blood pressure, heart rate, and exhaustion. This research investigates the neurophysiological and psychological impact of commuting in real-time, by analyzing brain waves and applying machine learning. The participants were healthy volunteers with mean age of 30 years. Portable electroencephalogram (EEG) data were acquired as a measure of stress level. EEG data were acquired from each participant using non-invasive NeuroSky MindWave headset for 5 continuous activities during their commute to work. This approach allowed effects to be measured during and following the period of commuting. The results indicate that whether the duration of commute was low or large, when participants were in a calm or relaxed state the bio-signal alpha band exceeded beta band whereas beta band was higher than alpha band when participants were stressed due to their commute. Very promising results have been achieved with an accuracy of 97.5% using Feed-forward neural network. This work focuses on the development of an intelligent model that helps to predict the impact of commuting on participants. In addition, the result obtained from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule also suggests that participants experience a considerable rise in stress after their commute. For modelling of cognitive and semantic processes underlying social behavior, the most of the recent research projects are still based on individuals, while our research focuses on approaches addressing groups as a complete cohort.

However, current emotion recognition methods have some drawbacks such as inconsistency in brain network size, lack of effective mining of features in different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional feature extraction method based on MSTBN and EEMD-WPT for emotion recognition. Firstly, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) is utilized to decompose the pre-processed electroencephalography (EEG) signals into four frequency bands ($\theta,\alpha,\beta$, and $\gamma$), and phase locking value (PLV) is used to construct multi-band connectivity matrix. Secondly, to remove redundant information, the minimum spanning tree based brain network (MSTBN) is established and MSTBN features are extracted including global features and local features. Thirdly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and WPT (EEMD-WPT) are applied to EEG signals for a more refined decomposition of modes and bands. Then, the modified multi-scale sample entropy (MMSE) and fractal dimension (FD) are extracted to capture the neural activity processes in the brain. Finally, the MSTBN features are fused with the nonlinear features MMSE and FD, which are input into random forest (RF) to identify emotions. Experimental results on DEAP dataset indicate that the accuracy is 87.24% and 89.84% for valance and arousal. Experimental analysis reveals that MSTBN of negative emotions is more divergent and emotional information is transmitted more rapidly in the brain. Women are more susceptible to emotional perception than men. The proposed multidimensional feature extraction method has potential to be applied to HCI systems.","","978-1-6654-6819-0","10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995251","Emotion recognition;EEG;Brain network;EEMD;MMSE","Human computer interaction;Radio frequency;Emotion recognition;Neural activity;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Wavelet packets","","","","15","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most prominent techniques employed to suppress the EEG artifacts is Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This technique separates EEG signals into Independent Components (ICs) and then discriminates EEG artifacts from neurally generated brain signals. Nevertheless, the source separation of ICA algorithm is imperfect. The IC identified to be an artifact can include brain wave activities useful for state classification.

This study introduces a novel framework to define and quantify brain activity from a functional perspective, combining spiking neural networks with Electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. Single neuron dynamics is described via the Izhikevich model, and each channel activity is modeled as the outcome of a distinct population of cortical inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Functional interactions among distinct populations are also modeled. We validate this framework by testing it with a dataset of real recordings from 30 healthy subjects undergoing a cold pressure test. Our findings reveal a global enhancement of neural spiking activity during the elicitation session, especially in the ß and $r$ bands. Results suggest that the proposed model is capable of describing the underlying functional neural activity of brain dynamics and showing significant variability between a resting state session and the cold pressure session. The proposed method paves the way for a functional alternative of brain source localization problems.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9361-7","10.23919/EUSIPCO63174.2024.10715062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715062","Electroencephalography;neural dynamics;neural modeling","Location awareness;Neural activity;Neurons;Spiking neural networks;Brain modeling;Noninvasive treatment;Electroencephalography;Recording;Signal analysis;Testing","","","","24","","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A parallel study has also been carried out on healthy volunteers of under fifteen years to find the comparison of neural activity between different age groups. In order to assess the brain pathophysiology in supratentorial brain lesion patients the quantitative EEG parameters such as delta/alpha ratio (DAR) and delta-plus-theta to alpha-plus-beta ratio (DTABR) have been used. It is observed that the DAR and DTABR values of the left cerebral hemisphere of the patient are much higher than the right cerebral hemisphere. It is also higher in both cerebral hemispheres than the control. A threshold value of ~3.7 for DAR and ~3.5 for DTABR has been obtained. It is found that delta and DAR indices of the old age are twice than the child, indicating the diminishing of neuronal activity of old age is half of the child.

This study is an attempt to find the relation of electrode location and latencies of EEG data with specific aspects of facial emotions. A neural network was applied to single trial EEG data for classifying the type and intensity level of facial emotions. Images of two types of facial emotions (happiness and disgust) with two intensity levels (high and low) were parametrically controlled and presented as main stimuli to evoke brain signals. Results of this study indicated that data from electrodes over the right-posterior area in the time-range window 80 to 200 ms post stimulus presentation contains P100 and N170 components strongly related to the process of recognition of facial emotions. Relative to other components, N170 was strongly related to the intensity levels of facial emotion, where it could be used for classifying low and high intensity levels of facial emotion. P100 and N170 can be used for classifying the type of facial emotions, with the accuracy when using P100 being slightly higher. Time-range window 200 to 280 ms contains N2, which can also be used for classifying the intensity level of facial emotion, but its accuracy is less than that of N170. Data from time-range window 300 to 360 ms, which contains the P300 component, was not significant for classifying type and intensity level of facial emotion relative to that of other components. This study is the first to show the possibility of using other components besides P300 for EEG-based BCIs.

This study endeavors to contribute to this burgeoning area by conducting a comprehensive analysis of EEG signals to predict physiological responses in a diverse range of scenarios. Leveraging advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning methodologies, our research focuses on extracting meaningful features from EEG data and developing predictive models to discern physiological states. In the pursuit of our objectives, a robust experimental setup was established, incorporating state-of-the-art EEG acquisition systems with strategically placed electrodes. Participants from varied demographic backgrounds were subjected to stimuli designed to elicit distinct physiological responses, while concurrently recording EEG signals. Preprocessing of the EEG data involved artifact removal, filtering, and segmentation to ensure the integrity of the dataset. Brain activities are the neural processes that underlie various mental functions, such as perception, attention, memory, emotion, and cognition. Key EEG features were carefully selected based on their relevance to physiological responses, encompassing spectral power, connectivity measures, and event-related potentials. Signal processing algorithms, including wavelet transforms and time-frequency analyses, were employed for feature extraction. Subsequently, a predictive model, rooted in machine learning, was developed to correlate these extracted features with physiological responses.

To address this problem, we developed a healing robot which conducts shirodhara (an oil treatment) in a computerized reproducible manner. The physio-psychological changes during taila dhara conducted by the healing robot and an estimated psychological experiences during taila dhara by psychometric studies of anxiety and altered states of consciousness (ASC) were studied. The physiological changes of the practitioners themselves were checked. Sixteen healthy adult females (ages 21-56, 33 /spl plusmn/ 9 years) signed informed consent and participated in this study. During shirodhara the monitoring items for the subjects were: blood pressure and intermittent blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG) R-R intervals, expired gas analysis, impedance cardiography and electroencephalogram (EEG). The single EEG (C3 lead) of the technician was recorded at the same time, and respiratory movement of the chests of both subject and technician were also recorded. In the active studies, shirodhara was performed by a machine with a pumping and heating system. The subject's feelings during shirodhara showed deep restfulness with less anxiety - as if the subjects were between the sleep and awake states. Shirodhara induced bradycardia and the relative suppression of LF/HF power spectrum density, which indicated lowered sympathetic tone. Expired gas analysis showed a decreased tidal volume and CO/sub 2/ excretion. The EEG showed the slowing of the /spl alpha/ wave, an increase in /spl alpha/ and /spl theta/ activity and an increase in right-left coherence. These metabolic, ECG, and EEG findings support the reported experiences of relaxed and low metabolic states during shirodhara. Physiological changes during shirodhara were similar to those of meditation, including /spl alpha/-wave dominance in the frontal area and a decrease in heart rate and CO/sub 2/ excretion. These findings indicated a change in the function of the frontal lobe, limbic system, brain stem, and autonomic nervous system. On the other hand, the EEGs of the technicians of the manual shirodhara showed an increase in their stressful condition, which may also justify the utility of the healing robot as an assistant for the technicians.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2005.1411351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411351","","Robots;Electroencephalography;Biomedical monitoring;Medical robotics;Petroleum;Psychology;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;Medical treatment;State estimation","Adult;Anxiety;Anxiety;Anxiety;Carbon Dioxide;Complementary Therapies;Consciousness;Consciousness Disorders;Consciousness Disorders;Electroencephalography;Evidence-Based Medicine;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Physical Stimulation;Robotics;Sesame Oil;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","19","","20","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Since it is very hard to fake an EEG signature or to attack an EEG biometric system, this paper presented a biometric security system that based on EEG signal processing. A new investigated method for person identification using the EEG Brain Signal processing is introduced. The proposed method based on executing a voting scheme between the 3 feature extraction methods which achieved maximum classification rates in the preliminary test. Preliminary test used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) for features extraction with two different measures with each of them, thus a total of 4 different methods, produced 4 different features sets. Classification rates were 93%, 87% & 93% using the 3 recommended features sets. After executing the proposed voting scheme, classification rate increased to 100%, for 3 subjects' experiment which surpassed the results from the previous works in this application. Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network trained by a standard back propagation algorithm is used as a classifier. Taking into account of reducing distraction to subjects, 4 channels only were used in the experiment and the subject need only to sit with eyes closed and quiet, which free the physical requirements of users and the condition of applying environment.","","978-1-4673-0126-8","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141420","EEG Signal processing;Biometric Security;Person Identification;Pattern Recognition of Brain Signals","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Wavelet packets;Discrete Fourier transforms;Biological neural networks;Discrete wavelet transforms;Security","","33","","24","IEEE","30 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We map the emotions of the robot to specific facial feature parameters, characterize recognisability of archetypical facial expressions, and introduce pupil dilation as an additional degree of freedom for emotion conveyance. Human interaction experiments demonstrate the ability to effectively convey emotion from the hybrid-robot face to humans. Conveyance is quantified by studying neurophysiological electroencephalography (EEG) response to perceived emotional information as well as through qualitative interviews. The results demonstrate core hybrid-face robotic expressions can be discriminated by humans (80%+recognition) and invoke face-sensitive neurophysiological event-related potentials, such as N170 and vertex positive potentials in EEG. The hybrid-face robot concept has been modified, implemented, and released in the commercial IoT robotic platform Miko (“My Companion”), an affective robot currently in use for human–robot interaction with children. We demonstrate that human EEG responses to Miko emotions are comparative to that of the hybrid-face robot validating design modifications implemented for large-scale distribution. Finally, interviews show above 90% expression recognition rates in our commercial robot.

However, traditional gait-phase-specific EEG analysis only measures the brain activities in the isolated gait phase, but neglects the between-gait-phase interactions as well as the whole-gait-cycle characteristics, and therefore is unable to effectively reflect the abnormal cortical gait control. Methods: In this study, we introduced three whole-gait-cycle measures of intra-stride EEG activity (i.e., mean desynchronization, amplitude of fluctuations, and coupling to the gait phase), and investigated their abnormalities in PD and relationships with gait impairments, which were further compared with the traditional gait-phase-specific measures. Results: Compared with healthy controls, PD patients showed overwhelming stronger desynchronizations (ERD) across the whole gait cycle in θ, α and low-β bands, implying a cortical compensatory strategy in response to the low efficiency of the motor network. Patients also exhibited weaker intra-stride ERD fluctuations in the central area in α and low-β bands, with reduced amplitude and less coupling to the gait phase, which were correlated with gait impairments in walking speed, gait rhythm and walking stability. However, gait-phase-specific EEG measures did not show any significant correlation with gait impairments in PD. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the efficiency of whole-gait-cycle EEG measures in characterizing the abnormal cortical gait control, and for the first time, associated gait impairments with weak intra-stride electrocortical fluctuations.

The intelligibility of the recovered speech in this study was not high enough, however, our findings show a possibility to reconstruct speech from non-invasive EEG in the future.","","979-8-3503-9796-3","10.1109/ISCSLP57327.2022.10038234","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038234","neural entrainment;source localization;noise-vocoded speech (NVS);non-invasive EEG;speech spectrogram reconstruction","Neurological diseases;Neural activity;Speech recognition;Oral communication;Electroencephalography;Encoding;Recording","","1","","21","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study evaluates the performance of a P300 speller and EEG signal quality using 4-, 6-, 8-, and 16-electrode configurations in two different office environments. Ten healthy adults participated in a single session, using a P300 speller to spell three words with each electrode set. Participants were split between two locations, with five individuals in each. Significant performance disparities were observed between the locations. Notably, within each location, the performance differences among 4-, 6-, and 8-electrode sets were minimal; only the 16-electrode set outperformed the others in both settings.

Traditional research on mobile app interface design has relied mainly on questionnaire and eye-tracking methods for behavioral analysis. This research adds a new dimension by examining the neural mechanisms associated with dynamic icons. We employed EEG to analyze channel-wise power spectrum density (PSD), focusing on the alpha and theta frequency bands related to attention and working memory. Concurrently, eye-tracking data were analyzed through Areas of Interest (AOIs) and fixation metrics to assess visual attention patterns. The results indicate that dynamic icons significantly enhance neural activity, with a 15% increase in alpha band power and a 20% increase in theta band power compared to static icons. Additionally, eye-tracking data show a 30% increase in total fixation duration on AOIs containing dynamic icons, particularly in the left-top quarter of the mobile interface. This effect was observed without changes in the first fixation duration, suggesting that dynamic icons have a stronger impact on sustained attention rather than on initial capture. These findings highlight that dynamic icons not only attract and maintain visual attention more effectively but also enhance cognitive processing efficiency. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing mobile app interface design, emphasizing the benefits of incorporating dynamic elements to improve user engagement and interface effectiveness.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822366","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822366","EEG;Eye-tracking;Dynamic Icon;Mobile App Interfaces","Measurement;Visualization;Neural activity;Modulation;Focusing;Gaze tracking;Dynamic scheduling;Electroencephalography;Mobile applications;Bioinformatics","","","","9","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique was tested to detect the N400 which is an ERP generally associated with recall. The chief advantages of the proposed technique are that it is robust to different ocular artifacts and yet sensitive to event related potentials. Further each signal will correspond to only a few features as opposed to 100s and 1000s of features obtained by traditional feature extraction techniques. The proposed steps involve a) Computing the first and second order difference of the data b) measuring mean and variance respectively for first and second order differencing over 1 second windows c) repeating the steps a and b after lagging the signal by 0.5 seconds. Differencing computes the change in amplitude of EEG signals, which is considered important in ERP analysis. Step (b) is a unique way of getting rid of abrupt signal changes which are artifacts, as for abrupt changes in the signal; the computed variance of the second difference is high. Also, computing windowed average of the first difference reveals the (increasing/ decreasing) trend of the data. Step (c) ensures that potential changes are not missed if they lie across two windows during the first phase of windowing. The proposed approach of feature extraction by the above steps outperforms three established traditional feature extraction schemes in identifying N400 waveforms using support vector machines.

This is due to complications from high and severe stress because of economic factors, family and environmental problems. High and severe stresses are not only experienced by the individual in a society, but also by government staff such as members of the police. The heavy workload, such as handling demonstrations with high escalation, is one of the factors that cause police members to experience high stress. Psychological assistance and healing such as in-depth interviews and psychological assessment tests have been carried out to map the psychological barriers and stressful conditions of police officers. The use of an Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the physiological signals that can be used to measure and recognize stress based on data on human brain activity. This research is exploring stress state by using eeg signal analysis in time domain. The analysis is done based on EEG time-domain features in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), and beta (13-30Hz) frequency bands from two different channels, namely F3 and F4 in the 10/20 EEG system. Twenty members of the state police (10 under stress conditions and 10 in normal conditions) are involved in this study. Statistical features such as Mean, Standard Deviation, and Zero Crossing are used to distinguish between stress and normal conditions. The experimental results showed that the Standard Deviation feature on the Alpha subband provided the highest difference in comparing between normal and stress conditions.

The analysis of such data have been conducted with analysis method that taken into account the particular nature of the data simultaneously gathered from different subjects.. We called these methods hypermethods. In particular, we estimate the concurrent activity in multiple brains of the group and we depicted the causal connections between regions of different brains (hyperconnectivity). The resulting causality patterns will link certain areas of the brain of a subject to the waveforms obtained from the other brain areas of another subject of the same group. Results obtained in a study of several groups recorded by the hyperscanning reveals causal links between prefrontal areas of the different subjects when they are performing cooperative games in different frequency bands.

For deep understanding of neural mechanisms inside human brain, it is desirable to get the higher spatiotemporal resolution of human brain at the same time. Concurrent EEG-fMRI data recording solve the problem of higher spatiotemporal resolution. It can be also helpful to understand the neural mechanism inside human brain effectively.

Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated different brain activities related to errors. Meanwhile, the recognition of error-related brain activity as one aspect of performance monitoring has been reported for potential applications in clinical neuroscience and brain-machine interface, where single-trial analysis and classification would provide novel insights on dynamic brain responses to errors. However, procedures of selecting features, as well as procedures of single-trial classification, are not fully investigated for optimal performance. In the present study, we investigated the performance of different configurations of feature extractions in both temporal and frequency domains, for discriminating response errors in a color-word matching Stroop task. Motivated by our previous investigations, we evaluated both temporal and frequency features with component signals, which were obtained from EEG signals via an independent component analysis (ICA). Five component signals (independent components, ICs), originated from the frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital areas, were included in detecting error-related brain activity from single-trial EEG data. The results showed that better performance can be achieved by optimizing time window and frequency range of selected features, sampling scheme of feature-related data, and training of classifiers. However, a simple combination of features from multiple component signals can only slightly improve the detection performance of errors in single-trial data as compared to the frontal IC only. More importantly, it is indicated that four ICs other than the frontal one also carry similar discriminative information about errors in both temporal and frequency domains. The fact suggests flexible means in detecting errors from EEG beyond the frontal brain areas, which might be very valuable in practical applications such that the frontal area is not accessible.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0220-4","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591303","","Integrated circuits;Feature extraction;Brain;Electroencephalography;Time-frequency analysis;Scalp;Monitoring","Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Reproducibility of Results","1","","13","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As EEG signals are known to be non-stationary, one common approach to analyze them has been time-frequency analysis. Time-frequency distributions allow us to represent the time-varying energy content of the signals across different frequency bands. However, analyzing multichannel EEG data across multiple experimental conditions and subjects in the time-frequency domain results in highly redundant representations. In order to reduce the dimensionality and extract relevant features in the time-frequency domain, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely utilized. Time-Frequency PCA (TF-PCA) provides a data-driven way to reduce the time-frequency surfaces into a few meaningful components. In many clinical studies, it is not only sufficient to reduce the EEG data into a few interpretable components, it is also important to discriminate between different experimental conditions or subject groups. In this paper, we extend TF-PCA by employing recently introduced contrastive PCA (cPCA) to discover low-dimensional structure that discriminates between two datasets. The proposed TF-cPCA approach is evaluated on an EEG study to discriminate between experimental conditions and brain regions from event-related potentials recorded during a cognitive control task.","2576-2303","979-8-3503-5405-8","10.1109/IEEECONF60004.2024.10943062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10943062","","Electrodes;Computers;Time-frequency analysis;Neural activity;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Principal component analysis;Diseases","","","","14","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Diagnosing psychiatric disorders early increases the chances of full recovery for patients and prevents their health from deteriorating. However, detecting psychiatric disorders early is often difficult. The goal of this paper is to design a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered methodology for detecting different psychiatric disorders by analyzing the EEG (electroencephalography) signals of humans. A deep learning-based classifier model named PsyNet is designed for this purpose. The designed PsyNet model consists of a stacked autoencoder network and an attention mechanism-based proposed PLSTM (Potent Long Short-Term Memory) classifier model. The designed PsyNet model is capable of detecting six different psychiatric disorders, such as addiction disorder, trauma and stress-related disorder, mood disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety-related disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, using the extracted EEG features from the EEG signals of the prefrontal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, motor cortex, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. The classification accuracy of the trained PsyNet model is 95.97%. The novelty of this research lies in i) proposing a new architecture of LSTM named PLSTM and using it as a classifier, and ii) incorporating the attention mechanism in the PLSTM classifier network of the PsyNet model to improve its prediction accuracy.","","979-8-3503-6066-0","10.1109/IACIS61494.2024.10721733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10721733","PsyNet;PLSTM;Stacked Autoencoder;Psychiatric Disease Detection;Attention Mechanism;EEG signals","Accuracy;Mood;Addiction;Anxiety disorders;Computer architecture;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Long short term memory;Diseases","","","","28","IEEE","24 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results revealed that theta frequency at the right temporal and parietal lobes was more activated during crossing and converging conflicts than during overtaking one. Alpha frequency at the right frontal lobe was more activated during non-level conflict. These findings indicated significant effects of lateral and vertical factors, respectively. Converging and crossing conflicts induced higher stress than overtaking one. Furthermore, conflict occurring when both aircraft were at similar altitude also required higher cognitive load.

Contemporary stimuli-driven BCI paradigms benefit mostly from the P300 ERP latencies in so called “aha-response” settings.

However, this cluster-based approach would be problematic if the significant differences were strong and sustained in time, but varied greatly in space. In other words, neural generators, which contributed to the detected significant differences, changed markedly within the explored temporal-cluster. To solve this problem, we implemented a statistical approach based on topographical segmentation analysis, which did not only make use of the temporal adjacency of significance, but also utilized the scalp distribution of statistical difference. We applied this technique to assess the significant difference of SEPs between deviant and standard conditions, and we observed that temporal ROIs, captured distinct spatial distributions of statistical difference, could be correctly identified using the topographical segmentation analysis be means of quasi-stable scalp distribution.","2165-3577","978-1-4799-4612-9","10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900772","topographical segmentation analysis;temporal region-of-interests;event-related potentials (ERPs);somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs);scalp topography","Standards;Scalp;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Digital signal processing;Surfaces;Electric potential","","","","15","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among various constraints in designing such a system, three important constraints are energy consumption, data compression, and device cost. Conventional data compression methodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significant energy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emerging data compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints. However, EEG is nonsparse in the time domain and also nonsparse in transformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremely difficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality that satisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications. Recently, block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method to the CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring of EEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better than state-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These results suggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and other nonsparse physiological signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2217959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297447","Block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL);compressed sensing (CS);electroencephalogram (EEG);healthcare;telemonitoring;wireless body-area network (WBAN)","Electroencephalography;Sparse matrices;Sensors;Dictionaries;Wavelet transforms;Compressed sensing;Energy consumption","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Databases, Factual;Electroencephalography;Humans;Remote Sensing Technology;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemedicine;Wireless Technology","216","1","13","IEEE","7 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than selecting a single electrode or matricizing the third-order tensor that can be naturally used to represent multi-channel EEG signals, we preserve the multi-way structure of EEG data and use a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) model to jointly analyze fMRI and EEG signals. Our analysis reveals that (i) joint analysis of EEG and fMRI using a CMTF model can capture meaningful temporal and spatial signatures of patterns that behave differently in patients and controls, and (ii) these differences and the interpretability of the associated components increase by including multiple electrodes from frontal, motor and parietal areas, but not necessarily by including all electrodes in the analysis.","2379-447X","978-1-4673-6853-7","10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050303","","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Tensile stress;Electrodes;Data models;Analytical models","","26","","21","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All EEG data were smoothened, the first 20 trials for each character were used for calibration, and the remaining trials were assigned to the test data set. Feature vectors for each trial were created as EEG waveforms from 100 up to 800 msec. after the stimuli was shown. To extract features of waveforms, the regression relationship between EEG and ERP waveforms was used to transform observed signals. As a result, the performance of cross validation rates of the test data set increased incrementally during the perceptual process, for both Fz and Oz, when the predicted waveforms were measured using the regression relationship. Also, the effectiveness of the prediction using the regression relationship for the classification performance of viewed characters was determined during the perceptual process. This provides evidence that a procedure using the relationship between EEG and ERP is effective in predicting viewed characters.","","978-0-9564263-3-8","10.1109/i-Society16502.2010.6018827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6018827","","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Training data;Training;Accuracy;Humans;Feature extraction","","1","","15","IEEE","15 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the consistency and repeatability of studies analysing the effectiveness of clinical guidelines, more reliable methodologies are required, particularly in the field of sport and muscle healthcare. Muscle spasms and tiredness are brief, painful, involuntary contractions of the skeletal muscles that can happen in a variety of circumstances [1]. While there is evidence that some cases may be linked to disturbances of water and salt balance, other cases appear to involve sustained abnormal spinal reflex activity secondary tofatigue of the affected muscles [30]. The causes and treatments for cramps that happen during or shortly after exercise or a sport activity are still unknown. It has been hypothesised that EAMC in marathonrunners is linked to high intensity, prolonged exercise, and steep terrain, all ofwhich can cause ""premature muscle fatigue"" in competitors with a history of cramping [30]. This paper's key subjects include the negative effects of sports on athletes, the methodology used to collect brain and muscle signals, and methods for combining these information. The association between brain activation and leg muscles is described with a complete and up-to-date examination.

However, in our study, the 360-degree image had no sound. The addition of natural sounds to the image may potentially enhance the relaxation effect. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of incorporating natural sounds into the 360-degree image for relaxation. We employ five evaluation metrics to measure the relaxation effect: electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate, salivary amylase, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a subjective stress questionnaire. These metrics are used to calculate the relaxation scores. The experimental results revealed a significant difference in relaxation scores derived from the EEG data.

The risk of premature death in epileptic patients is up to 3 times higher than the general population. To improve epilepsy patients' quality of life, the use of non-invasive brain rhythm, i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG) has an important role in detecting an epileptic seizure that is the hallmark of epilepsy. By measuring the complexity of the EEG signals from patients, various entropy methods are used for detecting a variety of types of epileptic seizures. Conventional entropy methods such as the Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Sample Entropy (SampEn) are dependent on data length and predetermined parameters. Here, we present a multiscale extension of Distribution Entropy (DistEn) that addresses the disadvantages of conventional entropy measures, which is referred to as multiscale DistEn (MDE). The proposed MDE is composed of a moving averaging procedure and DistEn estimation to reflect the reliable complexities over multiple temporal scales for short length EEG signals. The validation of the performance of MDE using actual normal and epileptic EEG signals is carried out. The experimental results show that MDE yields an outstanding performance in distinguishing the ictal EEG recordings compared to other entropy measures for short EEG recordings.","1976-7684","978-1-7281-9101-0","10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333993","National Research Foundation; Kwangwoon University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333993","epilepsy;epileptic seizure;electroencephalogram (EEG);Distribution Entropy (DistEn);Multiscale Distribution Entropy (MDE)","Statistical analysis;Sociology;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Robustness;Complexity theory","","1","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Functional connectivity of the human brain is a complex field requiring expert clinical knowledge due to the swift alterations in bodily functions, anomalies, and significant differences between individuals often present in EEG signals. These factors make it challenging to accurately classify EEG signals as normal or abnormal. However, the classification task can be made more manageable by using brain network representation of EEG signals. Brain network representation allows for the creation of a graph-based model of the functional connectivity of the human brain, which can be used to recognize important patterns and features in the EEG signals that are relevant to specific brain activities or conditions.

As such, it studies the neural activity associated with preference and purchase intent. Neuromarketing is considered an emerging area of research, driven in part by the approximately 400 billion dollars spent annually on advertisement and promotion. Given the size of this market, even a slight improvement in performance can have an immense impact. Traditional approaches to marketing consider a posteriori user feedback in the form of questionnaires, product ratings, or review comments, but these approaches do not fully capture or explain the real-time decision-making process of consumers. Various physiological measurement techniques have been proposed to facilitate the recording of this crucial aspect of the decision-making process, including brain imaging techniques [functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), steady state topography (SST)], and various biometric sensors. The use of EEG in neuromarketing is especially promising. EEG detects the sequential changes of brain activity, without appreciable time delay, needed to assess both the unconscious reaction and sensory reaction of the customer. Several types of EEG devices are now available in the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Researchers have conducted experiments using many of these devices, across different age groups and different categories of products. Because of the deep insights that can be gained, the field of neuromarketing research is carefully monitored by consumer and research protection groups to ensure that subjects are properly protected. This article surveys a range of considerations for EEG-based neuromarketing strategies, including the types of information that can be gathered, how marketing stimuli are presented to consumers, how such strategies may affect the consumer in terms of appeal and memory, machine learning techniques applied in the field, and the variety of challenges faced, including ethics, in this emerging field.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2021.3065200","Army Research Office under Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-20-2-0053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377473","E-commerce;electroencephalography (EEG);neuromarketing;neuroscience","Electroencephalography;Neuroscience;Brain modeling;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Consumer behavior;Neural activity;Pricing;Electronic commerce;Consumer behavior;Market research","","42","","191","IEEE","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their winning score is classified as poor or good by measuring the distance to the target achievement. The objective is to detect the stress pattern by observing the prominent features and window segments in the alpha band.

Our investigation found that the maximum amplitude and band power feature values were higher when the participants performed well, and this pattern is reversed when the participant's performance is poor. Meanwhile, based on brain area activity in a good performance, we found that central area activity is high from the first to the fourth segment. In contrast, occipital area activity is high only until the third segment. Following these parts, brain activity decreases compared to its previous state. This study also discovered that the significant segment window is located in the tenth segment, with a P-value < 0.05 between good and poor performance.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) may be utilised to measure and assess attention due to its high temporal resolution. Despite the existence of several suggested attention recognition braincomputer interfaces (BCIs), there has been a shortage of research including a substantial number of participants, suitable paradigms, and consistent analysis of recognition across people. This study examines the impact of visual stimulus quality on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and cognitive engagement. Visual cues are essential for triggering brain responses and cognitive processes. This research conducted an experiment to investigate the attention and non-attention states of participants during data gathering, both when they were stimulated and when they were not (baseline). The Mean Absolute Value (MAV) and Standard Deviation (STD) were used to assess the attention degree of participant’s EEG signals in relation to varying visual stimuli. The results of our study demonstrate a notable reduction in brain activity in the occipital areas when individuals are paying high attention, as opposed to low attention. In addition, it was shown that both MAV and STD features consistently dropped during active visual engagement, in comparison to baseline circumstances without stimuli. The MAV and STD are reduced by an average of $\mathbf{2 2 \%}$ during low attention compared to the baseline, while during high attention, both features decreased by $\mathbf{5 3 \%}$. The results might be ascribed to a phenomenon known as event-related desynchronization (ERD), which denotes the reduction in amplitude of EEG signals in particular frequency ranges during high attention or focus.","2767-7087","979-8-3503-7588-6","10.1109/ICICoS62600.2024.10636872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10636872","Consumer Attention;Brain Response;Neuromarketing;EEG","Visualization;Brain;Cognitive processes;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Informatics","","","","30","IEEE","21 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research study examines the classification of EEG data from a student whose brainwave patterns were irregular during academic challenges. The proposed study has first processed the data by smoothing the signals using a moving average feature, and then a variety of deep and machine learning methods are used to categorize the data. Our results demonstrate that the student's EEG data was unique and did not fit within established categories. Our analysis also revealed that the technology used to collect the data may have contributed to the irregular patterns. However, the data can be accurately classified by utilizing a deep learning approach. In addition to highlighting the value of properly processing the data to remove noise and artefacts, this research study demonstrates the potential of both deep learning and machine learning techniques in the interpretation of EEG data.

Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly used for monitoring and analyzing brain activity in newborns suffering from seizures. However, visual inspection of EEG signals can be error-prone and time-consuming, which can delay intervention. Deep learning algorithms, such as CNNs, have shown promise in classifying EEG signals for neonatal seizure detection. However, the multidimensionality of EEG recordings presents a challenge for using time-frequency representations (TFRs) as input for deep learning models. To address this challenge, recent research has explored alternative approaches, such as using a subset of the EEG channels that convey essential information about the brain’s activity. In this context, this paper proposes a novel approach for neonatal seizure detection using a minimized number of EEG channels and a TFD based on kernels with compact support. The proposed method employs a VGG19-BiLSTM mixed model to extract spatial and temporal features from the input data. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a publicly available Helsinki dataset. The obtained results demonstrate that this approach has the potential to significantly enhance the precision and expediency of neonatal seizure detection, potentially leading to more effective diagnosis and treatment outcomes.","","979-8-3503-0924-9","10.1109/ISPA59904.2024.10536771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10536771","Newborn EEG;Seizure;CNN;Time-frequency distributions;Polynomial kernel;VGG19;BiLSTM","Deep learning;Pediatrics;Visualization;Time-frequency analysis;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","1","","20","IEEE","27 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While subject-independent models are more generalizable and practical than subject-dependent models, they face challenges due to the high variability of EEG signals among individuals. One solution is identifying shared patterns during emotional processing. As deep learning has become a common practice for emotion recognition, using attentive network layers can help identify shared predictive patterns. This study explores this approach by using attentive network layers to identify brain areas relevant for predicting four emotions evoked by video clips in 15 individuals. The model achieved an average accuracy of 46% (95% CI: 41.3-50.7%) among subjects, indicating that the EEG channels in the right hemisphere were more relevant for predicting happy and neutral emotions, while those in the left hemisphere were more relevant for sadness and fear. These findings highlight the importance of including EEG channels from both hemispheres to ensure the prediction of different emotion types in subject-independent approaches. Clinical relevance— This study identifies shared neuronal patterns in emotion prediction, supporting the development of generalizable emotion recognition systems that can help diagnose and treat disorders such as depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781782","","Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Face recognition;Anxiety disorders;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Depression;Electroencephalography;Engineering in medicine and biology;Diseases","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Male;Female;Adult;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Deep Learning;Young Adult","","","18","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity of the seizure-related EEG waveform, its non-stationarity and degradation with distance due to the dispersive nature of the brain as a propagation medium, make localization difficult. Yet, precise estimation of the focus is critical, particularly when surgical resection is the only therapeutic option. The first step to solving this inverse problem is to estimate and account for frequency- or mode-specific signal dispersion, which is present in both scalp and intracranial EEG recordings during seizures. We estimated dispersion curves in both types of signals using a spatial correlation method and mode-based semblance analysis. We showed that, despite the assumption of spatial stationarity and a simplified array geometry, there is measurable inter-modal and intra-modal dispersion during seizures in both types of EEG recordings, affecting the estimated arrival times and consequently focus localization.","2165-3577","978-1-4244-3297-4","10.1109/ICDSP.2009.5201214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5201214","Encephalogram;Signal Dispersion;Time-Frequency Analysis;Seizures","Electroencephalography;Dispersion;Frequency estimation;Epilepsy;Degradation;Surgery;Inverse problems;Scalp;Correlation;Signal analysis","","","","19","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, the use of basic connectivity parameters based on graph theory applied to EEG signals, was explored as a quantitative tool to evaluate the effects in brain activity of an upper limb rehabilitation intervention. The approach was tested on a group of six stroke patients, using routine, resting-state EEG signals recorded from frontal, central and parietal regions, before and after their participation in an upper limb rehabilitation intervention using a P300-based Brain Computer Interface coupled to a Functional Electrical Stimulator. Brain connectivity was estimated through two complex parameters: node degree and clustering coefficient, calculated from two phase synchrony metrics (weighted phase lag index and spectral coherence) in the alpha (8–12 Hz) and lower beta (13–19 Hz) frequency bands. After the intervention, the average node degree for these patients was increased at central and frontal EEG electrodes, and the average clustering coefficient was increased at parietal and central positions. Furthermore, clinical scales showed improvements in upper limb function after the intervention. The next steps are to analyze the relationships between clinical and brain connectivity measures, and to follow up the patient brain and clinical state at mid and long-term spans.","2642-3766","979-8-3503-7754-5","10.1109/CCE62852.2024.10770865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10770865","network connectivity;phase synchronization;neuroplasticity;neurorehabilitation;quantitative EEG;Brain-Computer Interface;Functional Electrical Stimulation","Electrodes;Brain;Stroke (medical condition);Electrical stimulation;Motors;Electroencephalography;Graph theory;Frequency estimation;Indexes;Frequency synchronization","","","","10","IEEE","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric signals are primary means of communication between brain cells, and are constantly active, even during deep sleep. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a brain signal, which is used to measure electrical activity in the brain. To activate neurons, metal disk covered by electrodes is used which attach to the scalp and used as EEG recording for identification of any disorder. The EEG signals are useful for early detection of neurological disorders such as Epileptic seizure, Alzheimer, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and many more. Analyzing EEG data sets using classification techniques of machine learning or deep learning can bring meaningful insights on neurological disorder diagnostics. This paper reviews recent advancements in predicting neurological disorders such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, Autism, Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disorder and the promising effects and pitfalls. We have identified the best suiting classifier for each of the mentioned diseases and the accuracy achieved so far using EEG data. We implemented prediction of four common neurological disorders, namely autism, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia, from EEG data. We have received accuracy of 79.3% accuracy for predicting ASD, 63.3% with dataset of schizophrenia, 86.1% with PD and 94% with epilepsy disorder dataset.","","979-8-3503-1706-0","10.1109/ICCAMS60113.2023.10526205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10526205","EEG;ocular artifacts;autism disorder;Alzheimer’s Disease (AD);Pyramid dilated convolution (PDC);CNN;SVM;Gradient descent boosting;Machine learning (ML);Deep learning (DL);Time frequency distribution (TFD);Fast Fourier transmission (FFT)","Neurological diseases;Deep learning;Autism;Sleep;Mental disorders;Scalp;Epilepsy","","","","34","IEEE","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An electroencephalogram is a specialized diagnostic tool for monitoring brain activity electrically. Human brain anomalies and responses to stimuli can be deduced from EEG recordings. The presence of extraneous signals, known as artefacts, can cause distortion in EEG recordings. Since these aberrations introduce spikes that can be mistaken for neurological rhythms and since the properties of practically all biomedical signals vary with time, it is challenging to evaluate the EEG. Therefore, in order to guarantee an accurate analysis and diagnosis, noise and unwanted signals must be removed from the EEG. The identification of artefacts, or any potential deviation that has a source other than the brain, is a critical issue in this field. Artifacts can originate from a variety of sources, including the undesired movement of the eyes and eyelids, breathing, bodily movements, power line interference, muscular, cardiac activity, etc. The computational complexity is the primary subject of extensive research into adaptive filtering algorithms. The goal is to create a variety of novel ANC's for denoising EEG signals while taking into account computing complexity, Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Mis-adjustment, and convergence difficulties. This is done by taking into account three types of adaptive algorithms: The Least Mean Square (LMS) Adaptive algorithm and its several weight update variations.","","979-8-3503-4595-7","10.1109/IHCSP56702.2023.10127136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127136","EEG;LMS;ANC;Accuracy","Technological innovation;Heart beat;Scalp;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptive algorithms;Electroencephalography;Recording","","2","","17","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, attention has been given to the CatBoost, ResNet34D, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB2 models. The proposed approach utilized a vast EEG dataset with 11,000 samples of spectrograms, and it conducted an in-depth comparison of these models. Data preprocessing included features developed with statistical measures and the formation of uniform EEG spectrograms. All these models were evaluated in terms of their KL divergence score, defined as a measure of the divergence between the predicted and target distributions. From all the models considered, CatBoost proved to be one with an excellent performance, having had a KL score value at 0.78 compared to that of deep learning models.

Investigating the EEG alpha spectrum individually, by representing the ARR in terms of its emotional state, shows that, some EEG components produce negative relationships over others. By averaging these conflicting EEG components, it reduces the accuracy of an EEG-based emotion recognition system. This paper studies the relationship of the EEG within the alpha spectrum. Pearson, Spearman Rank and Kendall Rank correlation coefficient methods have been used to measure the dependency of the EEG components. From this study, it can be concluded that, EEG spectrums between 10 to 12 Hz are highly dependents between each other.

As such it may be possible to measure engagement but also to identify people who may not be able to engage fully, such as people with dyslexia.","","978-1-4799-5669-2","10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999282","BCI;usability;self-quantification;EEG","Electroencephalography;Training;Monitoring;Headphones;Biomedical monitoring;Usability","","3","","16","IEEE","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the temporal evolution of the topography of the average Event Related Potential (ERP) and we calculate the Fisher score of the sequence by taking the gradient of the trained model parameters given the sequence. In this context, the average Event Related Potential (ERP) is described as a sequence of topographies and the Fisher score describes how this sequence deviates from the learned HMM. This alternative modeling of the ERP is used to fuse EEG information, as expressed by the temporal evolution of the topography, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We use Canonical Partial Least Squares (CPLS) for the fusion of the Fisher score with fMRI features. In order to test the effectiveness of this method, we compare the results of this methodology with the results of CPLS using the average ERP signal of a single channel. Using this methodology we are able to derive components that co-vary between EEG and fMRI and present significant differences between the two tasks. The results indicate that this descriptor effectively characterizes the temporal evolution of the ERP topography and can be used for fusing EEG and fMRI for the discrimination of the brain activity on different tasks.","","978-1-4799-7502-0","10.1109/BIBE.2014.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033596","EEG;fMRI;Partial Least Squares;Fisher score;pattern analysis","Hidden Markov models;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Surfaces;Face;Image segmentation;Vectors","","","","33","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subjects viewed 8-s video clips while their brain activity was registered using EEG. The video signal was either uncompressed at full length or changed from uncompressed to a lower quality level at a random time point. The distortions were introduced by a hybrid video codec. Subjects had to indicate whether they had perceived a quality change. In response to a quality change, a positive voltage change in EEG (the so-called P3 component) was observed at latency of about 400-600 ms for all subjects. The voltage change positively correlated with the magnitude of the video quality change, substantiating the P3 component as a graded neural index of the perception of video quality change within the presented paradigm. By applying machine learning techniques, we could classify on a single-trial basis whether a subject perceived a quality change. Interestingly, some video clips wherein changes were missed (i.e., not reported) by the subject were classified as quality changes, suggesting that the brain detected a change, although the subject did not press a button. In conclusion, abrupt changes of video quality give rise to specific components in the EEG that can be detected on a single-trial basis. Potentially, a neurotechnological approach to video assessment could lead to a more objective quantification of quality change detection, overcoming the limitations of subjective approaches (such as subjective bias and the requirement of an overt response). Furthermore, it allows for real-time applications wherein the brain response to a video clip is monitored while it is being viewed.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2187672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151827","Electroencephalography (EEG);perception;video coding;video quality","Electroencephalography;Visualization;Humans;Covariance matrix;Distortion measurement;Vectors;Materials","Adult;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording;Vision Tests;Visual Perception","108","","38","IEEE","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, early detection of MCI has the potential to minimize the risk of AD by ensuring the proper mental health care before it is too late. In this paper, we demonstrate a single-channel EEG-based MCI detection method, which is cost-effective and portable, and thus suitable for regular home-based patient monitoring. We collected the scalp EEG data from 23 subjects, while they were stimulated with five auditory speech signals. The cognitive state of the subjects was evaluated by the Montreal cognitive assessment test (MoCA). We extracted 590 features from the event-related potential (ERP) of the collected EEG signals, which included time and spectral domain characteristics of the response. The top 25 features, ranked by the random forest method, were used for classification models to identify subjects with MCI. Robustness of our model was tested using leave-one-out cross-validation while training the classifiers. Best results (leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy 87.9%, sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 95%, and F score 85%) were obtained using support vector machine (SVM) method with radial basis kernel (RBF) (sigma = 10/cost = 102). Similar performances were also observed with logistic regression (LR), further validating the results. Our results suggest that single-channel EEG could provide a robust biomarker for early detection of MCI.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2911970","University of Memphis; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693868","Electroencephalography;event-related potential;mild cognitive impairment;speech-evoked brain responses","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Aging;Alzheimer's disease;Brain modeling","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Humans;Male;Mental Status and Dementia Tests;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Speech","72","","50","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the ANC performance, an optimal weight value is calculated and GWO is used to update optimal weight value. Testing of an adaptive filter has been done through consideration of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) over sample input EEG signals at various SNR levels. The performance of the GWO algorithm is evaluated in terms of mean value, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB and correlation. A comparative analysis shows that proposed GWO technique gives better performance when compared with the gradient-based techniques like RLS, LMS and swarm-based technique like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The novelty of this proposed approach can be considered, as because first-time GWO is applied on denoising EEG signals from the contaminated EEG signal, the result shows that extracting the desired EEG component is more effective in the proposed GWO method.","","978-1-7281-1380-7","10.1109/SPIN.2019.8711735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711735","Adaptive noise canceller;EEG/ERP signal;GWO;LMS;RLS;Optimization;SNR","Electroencephalography;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptive filters;Noise cancellation;Optimization;Signal to noise ratio;Mathematical model","","5","","45","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This emphasizes activity differences related to high-level percepts rather than low-level attributes. This design decision results in a difficult classification task for the ensuing EEG signals. Traditionally, EEG analyses are done on the basis of signal processing techniques involving multiple instance averaging and then a manual examination to detect differentiating components. The present study constitutes an agnostic effort based on purely statistical estimates of three major classifiers: L1-norm logistic regression, group lasso and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN); kNN produced the worst results. L1 regression and group lasso show significantly better performance, while being abl e to identify distinct spatio-temporal signatures. Both L1 regression and group lasso assert the saliency of samples in 170ms, 250ms, 400ms and 600ms after stimulus onset, congruent with the previously reported ERP components associated with face perception. Similarly, spatial locations of salient markers point to the occipital and temporal brain regions, previously implicated in visual object perception.

Unlike the traditional approach where the amplitude and latency of certain deflection points of event-related potentials (ERPs) are selected as electrophysiological biomarkers (or features) of MCI, we used the entire ERPs as potential biomarkers and relied on an advanced machine-learning technique, i.e. an ensemble of sparse classifier (ESC), to choose the set of features to best discriminate MCI from healthy controls. Five MCI subjects and eight age-matched controls were given the MoCA exam before EEG recordings in a sensory-deprived room. Traditional time-domain comparisons of averaged ERPs between the two groups did not yield any statistical significance. However, ESC was able to discriminate MCI from controls with 95% classification accuracy based on the averaged ERPs elicited by familiar faces. By adopting advanced machine-learning techniques such as ESC, it may be possible to accurately diagnose MCI based on the ERPs that are specifically elicited by familiar faces.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857203","","Biomarkers;Electroencephalography;Visualization;Face recognition;Neuroimaging;Electric potential;Diseases","Automation;Cognitive Dysfunction;Facial Expression;Facial Recognition;Humans;Machine Learning","1","","26","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims to delve into the neurophysiological dynamics of within-session attentional habituation and its correlation with Body Mass Index (BMI) concerning the repetition of high and low-calorie food, as well as non-food images. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured for both high and low BMI groups, as they repeatedly viewed the same food and non-food images. Analysis of ERPs on trial groups within each session revealed distinct effects of repeated image exposure on the brain’s attentional responses to food and non-food stimuli for both BMI groups. The result indicates that habituation effects and significance were observed in the parietal area of the brain for both BMI groups. Specifically, ERP responses to non-food image declined in motivation and attention over time, with significant changes observed within the 170-310 ms and 180-320 ms onset time windows for low and high BMI groups, respectively. However, no significant habituation effect was observed for both low/high caloric images in either BMI group. Additionally, ERP results indicated that high-calorie images exhibited a slower habituation rate, followed by low-calorie and non-food images across both BMI groups. In conclusion, this ERP study revealed that a habituation-like mechanism modulates attention towards repeated non-food images, while food images had a negligible effect in both groups. This suggests that the enhanced reward value associated with high-energy foods might lead to prolonged attention and diminished habituation, potentially contributing to obesity risks in individuals across different BMI groups.","","979-8-3503-8960-9","10.1109/ICDICI62993.2024.10810997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10810997","Body Mass Index (BMI);Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signal Processing;Event-Related Potential (ERP);Food Habituation;Repetition Visual Stimuli","Visualization;Body mass index;Obesity;Weight control;Image color analysis;Olfactory;Process control;Focusing;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography","","","","37","IEEE","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One possible explanation for these results may be that the participants changed their strategy in relation to executive functions during stressful conditions by paying more attention which resulted in a higher working memory capacity which enhanced performance during the task switching.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787673","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP180100670,DP180100656); Army Research Laboratory through the cooperative agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-10-2-0022,W911NF-10-D-0002/TO 0023); Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST 106-2218-E-009-027-MY3,MOST 106-2221-E-009-016-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240583","Acute stress;alpha power;attention;EEG;executive function;gamma power;theta power;working memory","Stress;Time factors;Switches;Analysis of variance;Electroencephalography;Standards","","23","","33","OAPA","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AutoTrainBrain software has been applied to a 14-year old dyslexic child, 10 minutes per week for 9 consecutive weeks. The EEG data has been analyzed by using the following three approaches: estimation of single-channel EEG complexity levels (entropy), spectral brain connectivity between two-channels (coherence), single channel relative Alpha band power ratio. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed brain training system offers improvements based on the measures used in the three approaches mentioned above.

However, its neural mechanism and relevant electroencephalography (EEG) features are still unclear. In this study, a new EEG-based familiar and unfamiliar faces classification method is proposed. We record the multichannel EEG with three different face-recall paradigms, and these EEG signals are temporally segmented and filtered using a well-designed filter-bank strategy. The filter-bank differential entropy is employed to extract discriminative features. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernels serves as the robust classifier for EEG-based face recognition. In addition, the F-score is employed for feature ranking and selection, which helps to visualize the brain activation in time, frequency, and spatial domains, and contributes to revealing the neural mechanism of face recognition. With feature selection, the highest mean accuracy of 74.10% can be yielded in face-recall paradigms over ten subjects. Meanwhile, the analysis of results indicates that the EEG-based classification performance of face recognition will be significantly affected when subjects lie. The time–frequency topographical maps generated according to feature importance suggest that the delta band in the prefrontal region correlates to the face recognition task, and the brain response pattern varies from person to person. The present work demonstrates the feasibility of developing an efficient and interpretable brain–computer interface for EEG-based face recognition.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2023.3332209","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271291); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020LZH009,ZR2021ZD40,ZR2021MF065); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10339904","Brain computer interface (BCI);differential entropy;electroencephalography (EEG);familiar and unfamiliar face classification;filter-bank","Face recognition;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Entropy;Support vector machines;Brain-computer interfaces;Filter banks","","4","","73","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the temporal non-stationary nature and inter-subject variability of EEG signals still pose a great challenge for the practical applications of EEG-based emotion recognition. To address the challenges, we propose a novel data generation workflow that combines multi-task learning. This workflow incorporates a generative pre-trained Transformer (EEGPT) to generate time-invariant components from raw EEG data. Additionally, we introduce a model training strategy called Contrastive Learning method for Time-invariant and Subject-invariant (CLTISI) EEG data generation. This strategy aligns inter-subject data into a shared high-dimensional space, imparting subject-invariant characteristics to the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated data not only improves the generalization of DL models but also adapts effectively to novel emotional stimuli. Furthermore, the CLTISI strategy enables DL models to maintain stable performance across diverse datasets.

In this study, we address this question by analysing EEG and fMRI data separately from a face processing task. We show that we are able to reliably estimate single trial (ST) dynamics of face processing in EEG and fMRI data separately in four subjects. However, no correlation is found between the modalities.

Our investigation focuses on evaluating the impact of both pre-stimulus and post-stimulus ERPs components on model performance. We trained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify auditory and visual ERPs using either a short window with only post-stimulus components or a long window with both pre-stimulus and post-stimulus components, then compared the model performance to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a baseline model. We employed an interpretable AI approach to examine the global feature importance by using feature importance of XGBoost, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for the SVM. XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 86% for both pre-post-stimulus and post-stimulus components, outperforming the SVM by 7 and 2 percentage points, respectively. The analysis of global feature importance revealed XGBoost's effectiveness in focusing on post-stimulus peaks and pre-stimulus components, aspects that the baseline model did not sufficiently capture.

We utilized amplitude-modulated vibrotactile stimuli, which have four envelope frequency levels and four amplitude levels. Relevant brain oscillations in five frequency bands and ten channels were measured by noninvasive EEG technique, and they were represented in baseline-based power spectral density (PSD) forms. Results, expressed in interaction effect maps and P-value topographic maps mainly, showed that there were significant interaction effects among envelop frequency, amplitude, frequency band, and electrode position. In particular, when envelope frequency (Fe)= 40 Hz, from alpha band 1 to beta band 1, for all four amplitude levels, brain oscillations over the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex decreased gradually. Additionally, a slight decrease of brain activation in the contralateral frontal regions was found in the two higher levels of amplitude. When amplitude (A)= 0.8 Grms, from alpha band 1 to beta band 1, for all four envelope frequency levels, brain oscillations over the bilateral sensorimotor cortex decreased gradually. In addition, a increase of brain oscillation in the frontal and parietal regions was found in the two higher envelope frequency levels.

Instead, quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis provide objective, automated measures of brain activity, allowing for a more comprehensive interpretation of EEG findings, with particular interest towards the features that can be difficult to detect during EEG analysis overcoming limitations of visual interpretation. In this work, visually-normal EEG signals from 26 patients with MTLE and 26 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed with the aim of compared spectral parameters between two groups of subjects to identify differences. In Matlab environment, with an ad hoc procedure, we calculated the total power of all EEG frequency bands and determined alpha-theta (ATR) and alpha-delta (ADR) power ratios for the whole brain and for the anterior, posterior, and temporal regions. We used statistical t-tests to compare the spectral parameters between two groups (p<0.05). Results showed that ATR and ADR ratios were significantly decreased in patients with MTLE compared to HC and on the contrary no differences have been observed for the power values of frequency bands. This study indicates that there is a difference in the power spectrum of qEEG between patients with MTLE and HC. Specifically, the power spectrum of qEEG in patients with MTLE is shifted towards lower frequencies, compared to HC. Moreover, these findings were observed in visually normal recordings, and this suggests that qEEG could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of MTLE even in cases where traditional visual analysis might not reveal any clear signs of epilepsy.","","979-8-3503-4347-2","10.1109/BATS59463.2023.10303161","European Union; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10303161","visually normal EEG;spectral analysis;quantitative EEG;spectral power abnormalities;mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE);Alpha Theta ratio(ATR);Alpha Delta ratio(ADR)","Location awareness;Temporal lobe;Visualization;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Sensors","","","","11","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trails were conducted to create a machine learning model to determine the varying levels of stress experienced by each subject. Blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and body temperature were also monitored and recorded. The EEG and fNIRS data was processed, tested, and verified using MATLAB to create the machine learning model. The data indicate that stress levels increased while the subject's quick decision-making skills were tested, and amplified as the difficulty of the computer game increased.

A Savitzky-Golay filter is utilized to smooth the EEG signals for enhancing the performance of eye blink classification. From the filtered EEG signals, the CNN model is applied to classify the left or right blinks for evaluating the relationship between the eye blinks and brain activity.

Reconstructing the brain network in the source space becomes more needed, for example, as a target in non-invasive neuromodulation. Precise estimating source activities from the scalp EEG is still challenging because it is an ill-posed question and because of the volume conduction effect. There is no consensus on how to reconstruct the EEG source network. This study uses simultaneous scalp EEG and stereo-EEG to investigate the effect of inverse solutions, connectivity measures, and node sizes on the reconstruction of the source network. We evaluated the performance of different methods on both source activity and network. Numerical simulation was also carried out for comparison. The weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) method achieved significantly better performance on the reconstructed networks in source space than five other connectivity measures (directed transfer function (DTF), partial directed coherence (PDC), efficient effective connectivity (EEC), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)). There is no significant difference between the inverse solutions (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE), and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming) on the reconstructed source networks. The source network based on signal phases can fit intracranial activities better than signal waveform properties or causality.

Results: Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. Our analysis revealed that our proposed pattern elicited more pronounced negative peaks in the parietal and occipital brain regions between 200 ms and 230 ms post-stimulus onset compared with the TF pattern.

The visual inspection of EEG data is prohibitively time-consuming and inefficient, even if the expert clinician reads the data ten times faster than the recording speed.

The approach is based on firstly identify the spatial filter weights using complete set of channels. In the next step, the channels are selected based on the maximal filter weights. Channels with highest values are included to find the accuracy in next run and ultimately the optimum combination of number of channels, CSP variant and classification accuracy are reported.

Previous research on the mechanisms underlying stress effects on human memory focused on stress-induced changes in the neural activity elicited by a stimulus. We tested an alternative mechanism and hypothesized that stress may already alter the neural context for successful memory formation, reflected in the neural activity preceding a stimulus. Therefore, 69 participants underwent a stress or control procedure before encoding neutral and negative pictures. During encoding, we recorded high-density EEG and analyzed—based on multivariate searchlight analyses—oscillatory activity and cross-frequency coupling patterns before stimulus onset that were predictive of memory tested 24 hr later. Prestimulus theta predicted subsequent memory in controls but not in stressed participants. Instead, prestimulus gamma predicted successful memory formation after stress, specifically for emotional material. Likewise, stress altered the patterns of prestimulus theta–beta and theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling predictive of subsequent memory, again depending on the emotionality of the presented material. Our data suggest that stress changes the neural context for building new memories, tuning this neural context specifically to the encoding of emotionally salient events. These findings point to a yet unknown mechanism through which stressful events may change (emotional) memory formation.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9246935","","","","1","","","Traditional","2 Nov 2020","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

For classification we used EEG amplitudes (raw signal) and the best accuracy was obtained for the time window 0–400 ms after the presentation of the math solutions from the fronto-central and parietal areas. Support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and three different convolutional neural network architectures (ShallowConvNet, EEGInception, EEGResNet) were used to classify the individual EEG/ERP data. Each model was trained 10 times. Each subject produced around 180 correct reactions to presented correct and incorrect solutions (50:50), thus 80% of each class was used for training and 20% for testing. For each model and each run, the average (median) classification accuracy was calculated. Neural networks showed better classification performance compared to linear methods (SVM, LR). Among the three neural network architectures, the best classification result on average for the group was obtained using EEGInception and EEGResNet: median 64.1%. The best individual classification accuracy reached 87.5% (EEGInception). When evaluating the informativeness of short time windows (200 ms with 100 ms increments from stimulus onset), it was shown that the best classification accuracies were observed either over the entire 0–400 ms interval or in the 200–400 ms interval from stimulus(solution) onset.","","979-8-3503-6373-9","10.1109/NeuroNT62606.2024.10585362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10585362","EEG;ERP;classification;ShallowConvNet;EEGInception;EEGResNet;SVM;LR","Support vector machines;Training;Logistic regression;Accuracy;Machine learning;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks","","","","7","IEEE","12 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical non-invasive BCIs based on event-related brain responses use EEG. In clinical settings, brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be advantageously used thanks to their high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we address the problem of the relationships between behavioral performance and single-trial detection by considering a task with different levels of difficulty. We consider images of faces with six different facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, neutrality, sadness, and happiness). We consider MEG signals recorded on ten healthy participants in six sessions where targets were one of the six types of facial expressions in each session. The results support the conclusion that a high performance can be obtained at the single-trial level (AUG = 0.903±0.045), and that the performance is correlated with the behavioral performance (reaction time and hit rate).","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512253","","Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Visualization;Sensors;Feature extraction;Magnetometers;Brain","Adult;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Facial Expression;Fear;Female;Happiness;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Male;Reaction Time","","","17","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture is hard to evaluate due to lacking of effective measurements of brain activity. In this work, we design an EEG-based monitoring system to evaluate therapeutic effect of acupuncture on human brain by extracting periodic-aperiodic features. Power spectral density is estimated to compute the adjusted power of periodic oscillatory rhythm in EEG under acupuncture stimulation. It is exhibited that the brain activity in alpha band (8–12 Hz) is significantly enhanced during acupuncture, especially in parietal and occipital lobe regions. To probe the modulatory effect of acupuncture on aperiodic brain activity, we calculate the aperiodic exponent based on the parameterization of EEG power spectra. The aperiodic exponent decreases along with acupuncture process, which is more significant in central and frontal lobe regions. Furthermore, sensitivity of different brain regions to acupuncture is assessed by the integration of adjusted power and aperiodic exponent. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed periodic-aperiodic measurements of EEG signals, by which different effects of four acupuncture manipulations are precisely evaluated and a knowledge graph is established.

In this study, an early detection framework based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data is developed for reducing the risk of these diseases. In existing frameworks, signals are often segmented into smaller sections prior to being input to a deep neural network. However, this approach ignores the fundamental nature of EEG signals as a carrier of valuable information (e.g., the integrity of frequency and phase, and temporal fluctuations of EEG components). As such, this type of segmenting may lead to information loss and a failure to effectively identify mental stress levels. Thus, we propose a novel multiclass classification framework termed multibranch LSTM and hierarchical temporal attention (MuLHiTA) for the early identification of mental stress levels. It specifically focuses on not only intraslice (within each slice) but also interslice (between different slices) samples in parallel. This was achieved by including two complementary branches, each of which integrated a specifically designed attention module into a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, enabling extraction of the most discriminative features from interslice and intraslice EEG signals simultaneously. The outputs of attention modules were then summed to obtain a feature representation that contributes to reduce overfitting and more effective multiclass classification. In addition, electrode positions were optimized using neural activity areas under high-stress conditions, thereby reducing computational costs by minimizing the number of critical electrodes. MuLHiTA was evaluated across one private [Montreal imaging stress task (MIST)] and two publicly available EEG datasets [EEG during mental arithmetic tasks (DMAT) and Simultaneous task EEG workload (STEW)]. These were divided into training and test sets using an 8:2 ratio, and the training data were further divided into training and validation sets using a fivefold cross-validation (CV) method, in which the model with the highest accuracy among the five was selected. The model was trained once more with the full training set, and the test data were then used to evaluate its performance. This approach achieved average classification accuracies of 93.58%, 91.80%, and 99.71% for the MIST, STEW, and DMAT datasets, respectively. Experimental results showed MuLHiTA was superior to state-of-the-art algorithms, including EEGNet, BLSTM, EEGLearn, convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional recurrent attention model (CRAM), for multiclass classification.

The auditory event related potentials (AEP) elicited by the consonant and dissonant intervals were combined and the PCA was used to extract discriminable features to classify the EEG recordings. Various linear and nonlinear classifiers were utilized for EEG classification and the results were also compared.

Multivariate filters can be used to isolate an ERP component of interest without the averaging procedure. However, we would like to have certainty that the output of the filter accurately represents the component. Methods: We extended the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which is traditionally used as a spatial filter for source localization, to be a flexible spatiotemporal filter for estimating the amplitude of ERP components in sensor space. In a comparison study on both simulated and real data, we demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the beamformer as well as a range of supervised learning approaches. Results: In the context of measuring the amplitude of a specific ERP component on a single-trial basis, we found that the spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer is a filter that accurately captures the component of interest, even in the presence of both structured noise (e.g., other overlapping ERP components) and unstructured noise (e.g., ongoing brain activity and sensor noise). Conclusion: The spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer method provides an accurate and intuitive way to conduct analysis of a known ERP component, without averaging across trials or subjects. Significance: Eliminating averaging allows us to test more detailed hypotheses and apply more powerful statistical models. For example, it allows the usage of multilevel regression models that can incorporate between subject/stimulus variation as random effects, test multiple effects simultaneously, and control confounding effects by partial regression.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2468588","Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme Belgian Science Policy(grant numbers:IUAP P7/11); interdisciplinary research project(grant numbers:IDO/12/007); industrial research fund project(grant numbers:IOF/HB/12/021); Financing program(grant numbers:PFV/10/008); Belgian Fund for Scientific Research at Flanders(grant numbers:G.0436.13,G.0883.14N,G.0A09.14N); UGent MRP “The integrative neuroscience of behavioral control”; Flemish Regional Ministry of Education (Belgium)(grant numbers:GOA 10/019); Flemish Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (TETRA project Spellbinder); SWIFT prize of the King Baudouin Foundation of Belgium; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202846","Beamformer;Brain models;Electroencephalography;Event-related potentials;Multivariate analysis","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Brain models;Noise;Generators;Training","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Humans;Male;Models, Neurological;Multivariate Analysis;Supervised Machine Learning;Young Adult","34","","52","IEEE","14 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research has shown that such threats often come from malicious insiders. To identify these insiders, survey- and electrocardiogram-based approaches have been proposed; however, these approaches cannot effectively detect or predict any malicious insiders. Recently, electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been suggested as a potential alternative to detect these potential threats. Threat detection using EEG would be highly reliable as it overcomes the limitations of the previous methods. This study proposes a proof of concept for a system wherein a model trained using a deep learning algorithm is employed to evaluate EEG signals to detect insider threats. The algorithm can classify different mental states based on four category risk matrices. In particular, it analyses brainwave signals using long short-term memory (LSTM) designed to remember the previous mental states of each insider and compare them with the current brain state for associated risk-level classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we performed a comparative analysis using logistic regression (LR)—a predictive analysis technique used to describe the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables—on the same dataset. The experimental results obtained suggest that LSTM can achieve a classification accuracy of more than 80% compared to LR, which yields a classification accuracy of approximately 51%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037979","Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Khalifa University(grant numbers:8474000137-RC1-C2PS-T3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9258932","Deep learning;EEG sensors;fitness evaluation;insider threats;LSTM;safety critical industrial infrastructure","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Security;Support vector machines;Safety;Feature extraction;Electrodes","","17","","32","CCBY","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many related studies focused on the correlation between movement kinematics and brain activity during movement execution or imagery. In this paper, we studied whether particular reaching parameters were encoded in the brain activity recorded by high-density EEG during the movement planning phase. Alpha and beta power over ten brain regions during the movement planning phase were correlated with reaction time/endpoint error during execution. The planning phase was divided into 2 movement planning intervals: 1) [0 250]ms and 2) [250 500]ms, with respect to the target onset to study the temporal characteristics of the power changes. Our results show that the greater the increase of the alpha band power in the left frontal region and the smaller the decrease of the beta band power in the right frontal region in the movement planning interval 2, the longer is the reaction time. A decrease of the beta band power in the motor and frontal regions from the two planning intervals correspond to a higher endpoint error. Moreover, higher alpha band power in the movement planning interval 2 over left parietal regions was related to smaller endpoint errors.","1948-2922","978-1-4799-5838-2","10.1109/BMEI.2014.7002782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002782","EEG;movement planning;alpha and beta band powers;reaction time;endpoint error","Planning;Electroencephalography;Brain;Scalp;Electrodes;Correlation;Decoding","","5","","16","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been proven to decrease stress by calming the individual and regulating brainwave activity. While some hospitals manually apply this therapy, our model automates the process using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This model employs IoT to seamlessly deliver data to the cloud, utilizing Raspberry $\text{Pi}$. We measure stress parameters using a pulse sensor and an electroencephalogram (EEG). Artificial neural networks (ANN) in the cloud then compare these measured values with pre-established threshold values. When a patient's pulse rate drops below the threshold, an emergency message is automatically dispatched to the physician. Furthermore, based on the patient's heart rate, the ANN categorizes the patient's health condition and stress level. A playlist, specifically curated to the patient's mood, is then played to alleviate stress levels. By leveraging cloud storage, the individual's status can be accessed conveniently through the internet or a dedicated mobile app on the patient's smartphone. Therefore, our model offers an innovative, nonpharmaceutical solution to manage and alleviate stress in modern life.","","979-8-3503-1512-7","10.1109/ICSCAN58655.2023.10395274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10395274","Pulse sensor;EEG sensor;Raspberry Pi;Internet of Things;Artificial neural networks (ANN);stress level;music therapy","Cloud computing;Pulse measurements;Medical treatment;Human factors;Medical services;Artificial neural networks;Brain modeling","","2","","14","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks.

One of the first steps in this research is to determine if a machine learning algorithm can identify to which instrument an individual is listening based only on a brief EEG signal. To test this possibility, participants were presented with a series of brief tones that varied in timbre (Trombone, Clarinet’ Cello, Piano and Pure Tone) while their ongoing EEG was recorded from 73 electrodes. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used. We investigated four different sets of features - Raw EEG, ERP-based features, Harmonics-based features and Regularity-based features. The Raw EEG based classifier performed significantly above chance (37%) when attempting to distinguish between responses to different musical instruments for 5-way classification. More advanced classification algorithms or different features may be able to better distinguish between tones with a musical timbre.","","978-1-6654-1020-5","10.1109/SMC54092.2024.10831757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10831757","timbre;machine learning;EEG;hearing","Electrodes;Instruments;Brain modeling;Hearing aids;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Classification algorithms;Timbre;Power harmonic filters","","","","15","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EEG signals are relatively weak, so the devices for acquiring the EEG signals are very sensitive. Therefore, during EEG acquisition, interfering signals that are not EEG activity are usually mixed in, and these interferences are known as artifacts,and the most common of these artifacts are from physiological sources including electrooculographic (EOG) artifacts, electromyographic (EMG) artifacts, and electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts. In order to know more accurately the intention of brain activity, after acquiring the EEG signal, some method must be taken to remove artifacts from it. The removal of these three artifacts is difficult and usually requires some specific methods to remove them. This paper describes the causes of these three artifacts and reviews the methods to eliminate them, and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of these methods through the conclusions of the published literature.","2693-9371","979-8-3503-6565-8","10.1109/QRS-C63300.2024.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727095","EEG;artifact removal;EOG;EMG;ECG","Electrooculography;Reviews;Software quality;Electrocardiography;Solids;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Physiology;Software reliability;Security","","","","39","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research describes a unique method for reliably identifying mental diseases based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used for feature selection with reduction, while Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used for classification. PSO is used to extract the most informative features from high-dimensional EEG data, whilst LSTM is utilised to capture temporal relationships within the signals. The research looks at five types of mental disorders: ‘Addictive disorder,’ ‘Trauma and stress-related disorder, ‘Obsessive-compulsive disorder,’ ‘Schizophrenia,’ and ‘Anxiety disorder’. To begin, PSO is used to optimise a fitness function and find the most significant characteristics, lowering the complexity of the EEG dataset. This stage removes unnecessary and superfluous characteristics, resulting in improved classification performance. Following that, the reduced feature set is put into an LSTM-based classifier, which learns patterns and correlations in the EEG signals. The model is trained on labelled data and its performance is assessed with a validation set. The suggested method obtains a validation accuracy of 90 %, proving its efficacy in effectively detecting and discriminating between various mental diseases.","","979-8-3503-0514-2","10.1109/CVMI59935.2023.10464768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10464768","Electroencephalogram;Psychiatric Disorder;Particle Swarm Optimization;LSTM","Correlation;Mental health;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Complexity theory;Reliability;Particle swarm optimization","","","","20","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications include brain-computer interfaces, artifact removal, and identifying parallel neural processes. We wish to address the issue of applying BSS to event-related responses, which is challenging because of nonstationary data. Methods: We introduce a new BSS approach called momentary-uncorrelated component analysis (MUCA), which is tailored for event-related multitrial data. The method is based on approximate joint diagonalization of multiple covariance matrices estimated from the data at separate latencies. We further show how to extend the methodology for autocovariance matrices and how to apply BSS methods suitable for piecewise stationary data to event-related responses. We compared several BSS approaches by using simulated EEG as well as measured somatosensory and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked EEG. Results: Among the compared methods, MUCA was the most tolerant one to noise, TMS artifacts, and other challenges in the data. With measured somatosensory data, over half of the estimated components were found to be similar by MUCA and independent component analysis. MUCA was also stable when tested with several input datasets. Conclusion: MUCA is based on simple assumptions, and the results suggest that MUCA is robust with nonideal data. Significance: Event-related responses and BSS are valuable and popular tools in neuroscience. Correctly designed BSS is an efficient way of identifying artifactual and neural processes from nonstationary event-related data.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2616389","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:283105); Finnish Cultural Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7589085","Blind source separation (BSS);electroencephalography (EEG);event-related fields;event-related potentials;independent component analysis;magnetoencephalography (MEG);transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)","Covariance matrices;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Blind source separation;Noise measurement;Data models","Adult;Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain Mapping;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","21","","37","IEEE","12 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The susceptibility to fake news attacks hinges on whether or not Internet users perceive a fake news article/snippet to be legitimate (real) after reading it. In this paper, we attempt to garner an in-depth understanding of users’ susceptibility to text-centric fake news attacks via a neuro-cognitive methodology (thus corroborating as well as extending the traditional behavioral-only approach in significant ways). In particular, we investigate the neural underpinnings relevant to fake vs. real news through EEG, a well-established brainimaging technique. We design and run an EEG experiment with human users to pursue a thorough investigation of users’ perception and cognitive processing of fake vs. real news. We analyze the neural activity associated with the fake vs. real news detection task for different categories of news articles.Our results show that there may be no statistically significant or automatically inferable differences in the way the human brain processes the fake vs. real news, while marked differences are observed when people are subject to (real or fake) news vs. resting state and even between some different categories of fake news. This neurocognitive finding may help to justify users’ susceptibility to fake news attacks, as also confirmed from the behavioral analysis. In other words, the fake news articles may seem almost indistinguishable from the real news articles in both behavioral and neural domains. Our work serves to dissect the fundamental neural phenomena underlying fake news attacks and explains users’ susceptibility to these attacks through the limits of human biology. We believe that this could be a notable insight for the researchers and practitioners suggesting that the human detection of fake news might be ineffective, which may also have an adverse impact on the design of automated detection approaches that crucially rely upon human labeling of text articles for building training models.","","978-1-6654-7398-9","10.1109/PST55820.2022.9851990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851990","","Training;Neural activity;Fasteners;Electroencephalography;Behavioral sciences;Internet;Labeling","","2","","45","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a spatial filter is constructed to estimate the ERP components. Then the most discriminative spatial and temporal features of the entire ERP waveform are extracted with linear discriminant analysis. The performance of this method is tested by classifying the emotional valence on three levels, the extremely negative, the moderately negative and the neutral, with the support vector machine (SVM).

The main problem in the use of EEG signals is that are often contaminated by physiological and non-physiological artifacts. EOG (electrooculogram) artifact is one of the first origins of artifacts in EEG recordings. It severely affects the EEG signal and modifies the shape of the neural activity that drive the BCI system affecting then its accuracy and performance. This paper presents an original algorithm to detect and remove EOG artifacts from EEG signals. In the proposed method, the statistical parameters extracted from the signal are used as the inputs of a fuzzy inference system to take a decision if an epoch of EEG is contaminated by the EOG or not. Thereafter, the level-5 stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is applied on the detected contaminated epochs to remove the artifacts without bringing much distortion to the neural activity. The performance of the developed algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios: semi-simulated artifactual EEG data and fully real artifactual EEG data. The presented results show that our algorithm outperforms some existing algorithms.","","978-1-6654-9807-4","10.1109/ICAC55051.2022.9911068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911068","Brain computer interface;Fuzzy logic;biomedical signal processing;artifact handling;wavelet transform","Wavelet transforms;Fuzzy logic;Electrooculography;Shape;Neural activity;Signal processing algorithms;Electroencephalography","","5","","33","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to maximally utilize the information contained in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording, many sophisticated multimodal data-mining methods, such as joint ICA, have been developed. However, these methods normally deal with data recorded in one experimental condition, and they cannot effectively extract information on activities that are distinct in two conditions. In this paper, a new data decomposition method called joint common spatial pattern (jCSP) is proposed. Compared with previous methods, the jCSP method exploits inter-conditional difference in the strength of brain source activities to achieve source separation, and is able to uncover the source activities with the strongest discriminative power. A group analysis based on clustering is further proposed to reveal distinctive jCSP patterns at group level. We applied joint CSP to a simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset collected from 21 subjects under two different resting-state conditions (eyes-closed and eyes-open). Results show a distinct dynamic pattern shared by EEG alpha power and fMRI signal during eyes-open resting-state.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318932","","Electroencephalography;Joints;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Matrix decomposition;Feature extraction","Algorithms;Brain;Electroencephalography;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Oxygen;Principal Component Analysis;Radiography;Spatial Processing","2","","13","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining or fusing these two techniques thus has the potential to provide simultaneous higher temporal and high spatial resolution. Localization of the brain's response to infrequent, task-relevant target 'oddball' stimuli in humans has remained challenging due to the lack of a single imaging technique with good spatial and temporal resolution.

These activities can be decoded by signal processing techniques. However, EEG recordings are always contaminated with artifacts which hinder the decoding process. Therefore, identifying and removing artifacts is an important step. Researchers often clean EEG recordings with assistance from independent component analysis (ICA), since it can decompose EEG recordings into a number of artifact-related and event-related potential (ERP)-related independent components. However, existing ICA-based artifact identification strategies mostly restrict themselves to a subset of artifacts, e.g., identifying eye movement artifacts only, and have not been shown to reliably identify artifacts caused by nonbiological origins like high-impedance electrodes. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm for the identification of general artifacts. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: 1) an event-related feature-based clustering algorithm used to identify artifacts which have physiological origins; and 2) the electrode-scalp impedance information employed for identifying nonbiological artifacts. The results on EEG data collected from ten subjects show that our algorithm can effectively detect, separate, and remove both physiological and nonbiological artifacts. Qualitative evaluation of the reconstructed EEG signals demonstrates that our proposed method can effectively enhance the signal quality, especially the quality of ERPs, even for those that barely display ERPs in the raw EEG.

The peak velocity and the peak acceleration could best reflect the feedforward-type movement; thus, it is worthwhile to investigate them further. Most related studies focused on the correlation between kinematics and brain activity during the movement execution or imagery. However, human movement is the result of the motor planning phase as well as the execution phase and researchers have demonstrated that statistical correlations exist between EEG activity during the motor planning and the peak velocity and the peak acceleration using grand-average analysis. In this paper, we examined whether the correlations were concealed in trial-to-trial decoding from the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG activity. The alpha and beta powers from the movement planning phase were combined with the alpha and beta powers from the movement execution phase to predict the peak tangential speed and acceleration. The results showed that EEG activity from the motor planning phase could also predict the peak speed and the peak acceleration with a reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the decoding accuracy of the peak speed and the peak acceleration could both be improved by combining band powers from the motor planning phase with the band powers from the movement execution.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2014.2327635","NSF(grant numbers:SMA-1041755,ENG-1137279); ONR MURI(grant numbers:N00014-10-1-0072); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823644","Alpha and beta band powers;EEG;movement execution;movement planning;peak speed and acceleration;Alpha and beta band powers;EEG;movement execution;movement planning;peak speed and acceleration","Planning;Electroencephalography;Acceleration;Decoding;Accuracy;Electrodes;Kinematics","Acceleration;Anticipation, Psychological;Brain;Electroencephalography;Executive Function;Female;Hand;Humans;Male;Movement;Psychomotor Performance;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult","26","","39","IEEE","30 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Biometric systems can employ different kinds of features, e.g., features of fingerprint, face, iris or posture. EEG signals are the signature of neural activities. It is confidential and hard to imitate, since EEG signals are a reflection of individual-dependent inner mental tasks. It has several advantages, such as (i) it is confidential as it corresponds to a mental task, (ii) it is very difficult to mimic and (iii) it is almost impossible to steal as the brain activity is sensitive to the stress and the mood of the person, an aggressor cannot force the person to reproduce his/her mental pass-phrase. In this paper we first proposed a novel algorithm to create a spatial pattern of EEG signals obtained from the open public database. In our EEG signal processing, we have analyzed 64-electrode EEG samples for two databases, one is for 45 people and calculate the equivalent root mean square (rms) values for each electrode signal over 1 second period, by which created a 64-value input for each subject. With neural network (NN) model, our analysis showed that our designed classifier is able to identify all the 45 people correctly (successful rate of 100%) with a mean square error of 2.0334×10−7 and the same algorithm applying to the 2nd database with 116 out of 122 people can be fully identified (successful rate of 95.1%) with a mean square error value of 0.00186.

An automated detection of epileptic seizures proves useful to Neurologists in the diagnosis of epileptic patients. This work contributes towards the study of efficacy evaluation of statistical features towards classification of EEG data as Ictal, Inter-Ictal and Normal. The statistical features considered are energy, entropy, median absolute deviation, interquartile range, skewness and kurtosis. The features extracted from a real dataset of 500 time series, comprising of 100 Ictal, 200 Inter-Ictal and 200 Normal are given to classifiers such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (Fuzzy k-NN), k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN) and Naive Bayes for three class classification. Each of the features were used separately for classification to determine their individual efficacies. Alongside, the popular feature ranking method ‘ReliefF’ has been used to rank the features.

This is caused by the overlapping frequencies of brain and myogenic activity and the higher amplitude of the myogenic signals. One commonly employed computational technique to reduce these types of artifacts is Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA estimates statistically independent components (ICs) that, when linearly combined, closely match the input (sensor) data. Removing the ICs that represent artifact sources and re-mixing the sources returns the input data with reduced noise activity. ICs of real-world data are usually not perfectly separated, actual sources, but a mixture of these sources. Adding additional input signals, predominantly generated by a single IC that is already part of the original sensor data, should increase that IC's separability. We conducted this study to evaluate this concept for ICA-based electromyogenic artifact reduction in EEG using EMG signals as additional inputs. To acquire the appropriate data we worked with nine human volunteers. The EEG and EMG were recorded while the study volunteers performed seven exercises designed to produce a wide range of representative myogenic artifacts. To evaluate the effect of the EMG signals we estimated the sources of each dataset once with and once without the EMG data. The ICs were automatically classified as either `myogenic' or `non-myogenic'. We removed the former before back projection. Afterwards we calculated an objective measure to quantify the artifact reduction and assess the effect of including EMG signals. Our study showed that the ICA-based reduction of electromyogenic artifacts can be improved by including the EMG data of artifact-inducing muscles. This approach could prove beneficial for locomotor disorder research, brain-computer interfaces, neurofeedback, and most other areas where brain activity during movement has to be analyzed.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944466","","Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Muscles;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Pollution measurement","Adult;Artifacts;Brain;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Male;Movement;Principal Component Analysis;Young Adult","4","","23","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stress becomes a concern when it affects a person's mental health, and sometimes it can even result in other chronic illnesses. Currently, stress-detection studies in the literature are often limited to laboratory studies or to specific situations. However, daily stressors are ongoing, and therefore, detection of stress in everyday life (outside the laboratory environments) is important to improve the wellbeing of individuals. Computer games are entertainment media that can be found in almost every household in the modern society. Statistics show that people spend hours playing computer games daily. The amount of data that gameplay generates and interactivity they provide via various human computer interfaces have a lot of potential in identifying behavior patterns of the players that could assist in the process of stress detection. As such, this survey attempts to identify the extent to which computer games can be used as a medium for stress detection. Toward this end, this survey reviews the existing stress-detection studies, both laboratory techniques as well as the techniques that can be used in a home-based environment. Finally, it summarizes the stress-detection techniques that can be used within games in order to make it an everyday technology that can be used to detect and monitor stress. In addition, it is expected that development of such a technology will be useful in providing objective data to the healthcare professionals for intervention and management. Such a technology is even more required in the current unprecedented situation the world has faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic as it can be developed as a technology to manage mental health issues people are facing due to home isolation.","2475-1510","","10.1109/TG.2022.3216404","University of New South Wales Canberra; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926147","Affective computing;gameplay;games;games for health;human–computer interaction;machine learning;serious games;stress detection","Human factors;Stress;Games;Stress measurement;Monitoring;Video games;Sensors","","2","","112","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our results of linear regression modeling show that the traditional EEG power spectrum was the only resting-state feature set that could predict in-car VRMS ratings. Further, the best regression result was achieved by beta power spectrum in the left parietal area with adjusted R2=22.6% versus 11.6% in the right. This result not only confirmed the left parietal involvement in motion sickness susceptibility observed in a previous resting-state fMRI study, but also advanced that methodology to mobile neurotechnologies, represented by mobile EEG, referenced by other types of resting-state features.

Unlike previous studies that investigated error-related negativity for only incorrect motor responses, we tracked ERN changes for all responses. We found that ERN decreased significantly from early to later stages of learning. We also observed a significant change in the P200 component associated with increased selective attention to relevant stimuli as learning occurred. Scalp topography showed the differences in neural activity during motor sequence learning in the frontal, central, and parietal regions. We then employed machine learning to identify the best predictors of motor learning stages. Using random forest, we found the most discriminating pattern for early versus late learning phases. The combination of three electrodes, including ‘C3-C4-P3’, obtained the maximum accuracy of 82% while classifying EEG signals corresponding to early and late stages of learning.

Given the differences in the nature of brain activities captured by resting-state and active task-related EEG, existing models might not be applicable to resting-state EEG. This study proposed an unsupervised hybrid deep feature encoder to learn robust feature representation in resting-state EEG data.

The detection of the direction intended movements and the type of intended movement is a challenging goal in neuroscience and engineering applications such as brain-computer interfacing (BCI). In previous studies, it has been reported that EEG signals extracted from PPC can be used to decode intended movement direction. However, it is not clear whether extracted EEG signals are related to motor intention, because visually evoked potential (VEP) which evoked by visual cue in their experiment may be included in their extracted EEG signals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of VEP mixed into extracted EEG signals. Therefore experiments with not only visual but also tactile cues were conducted. EEG components that could be related to PPC were extracted by using independent component analysis (ICA). We compared event related potential (ERP) waveforms between two experiments. In the result, ERP waveforms of the experiment with tactile cue were significantly different from that of the experiment with visual cue. This result suggests that VEP was included in the EEG signals extracted from PPC in the experiment with visual cue.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319919","","Visualization;Electroencephalography;Brain;Planning;Electrodes;Neuroscience;Integrated circuits","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cues;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Humans;Intention;Movement;Parietal Lobe;Touch","1","","13","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Seven respiratory parameters were used: respiratory rate, inhalation time, exhalation time, exhalation-inhalation ratio, inhalation time variability, exhalation time variability, and exhalation-inhalation ratio variability. Furthermore, the seven respiratory parameters were analyzed using representative psychophysiological indexes: relaxation scale, anxiety scale (STAI), sleep scale (PSQI-J), and pulse wave, EEG. Twenty-eight university students participated in the experiment. Simultaneous measurements with a band-type respiration sensor, an optical pulse wave sensor, and an electrode-type EEG sensor were performed for 5 min in a resting state after obtaining answers to each questionnaire, and finally, answers to the questionnaires were obtained again. A correlation analysis of the respiratory parameters and psychophysiological indexes revealed a positive correlation (r=0.41 and r=0.44, respectively) between state anxiety and the variability of inhalation and exhalation times (p<0.05). This result suggests that the variability of inhalation and exhalation times can potentially be used for mental health assessment.","","978-1-6654-9384-0","10.1109/MeMeA57477.2023.10171945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171945","respiratory;questionnaires;autonomic index;inhalation;exhalation;relax;anxiety","Correlation;Phase measurement;Sleep;Pulse measurements;Anxiety disorders;Mental health;Ventilation","","1","","13","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Theta wave relates with deep relaxation, day-dreaming and memory. Meanwhile Delta wave associates with deep sleep. Stress is a challenging condition that commonly happens in human life. There are various ways to cope with stress and one of them is to spend time for relaxation. Besides that, binaural beat can be used as a substitute for meditation to alleviate the stress. Binaural beat is the rhythmic stimulus which is generated to produce the desired audio frequency with the intention to make brainwave to follow that frequency. In the end of our research, the result shows that Theta brainwave increases after listening to binaural beat. Although the Delta brainwave is not really affected in this experiment, there is still an increment of delta brainwave after listening to binaural beat.

However, PTSD severity can vary depending on the traditional methods that the patient conducted. Today, neuropsychiatrists and related professions typically pair electroencephalography (EEG) usage with clinicians’ standard, subjective clinical assessments and patients’ self-reports for diagnostic specificity for PTSD treatment. In this study, we attempted to characterize the significant features and potential biomarkers that can quantify the severity of a patient based on its recorded electrical brain activity on EEG. We trained machine-learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), that can classify the PTSD severity of nine (9) study volunteers using the extracted features from the EEG signals. Results show that the most significant discriminative features were extracted from: (1) the frontocentral site (i.e., FCz electrode); (2) the right frontocentral site (i.e., FC4 electrode); and (3) the left parietal site (i.e., P3 electrode), described by the zero crossing rates, fractal dimensions, and beta-alpha ratios. It can be shown that PTSD severity increases as activity in these regions increases. Furthermore, the trained ANN only required one hidden layer with ten neurons for effective classification, while SVM required a third-order cubic polynomial of its kernel function. After training and testing, results show a testing accuracy of 97.75% for ANN and 99.07% for SVM. Thus, our proposed systems were able to accurately classify the severity of PTSD.","2831-4352","979-8-3503-3849-2","10.1109/BioSMART58455.2023.10162084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10162084","post-traumatic stress disorder;severity;electroencephalography;machine learning;artificial neural network;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Electrodes;Training;Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Brain modeling;Feature extraction","","3","","38","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, studying the phase synchronization of EEG signals after stroke is of great significance for understanding the communication and neuroplasticity of neurons after brain injury. In this paper, the changes of EEG phase synchronization in bilateral, cyclical ankle movements alternately after stroke were studied by Hilbert transform. Ten stroke patients and six healthy adults participated in the test. The results showed that the inter-hemisphere phase synchronization index (inter-PSI) and the global PSI of patients were significantly lower than that of the healthy subjects during the task. The PSI between Cz and the affected sensory cortex associated with lower limb movements was also significantly lower than that in the control group. There was a significant negative correlation between National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and cortical synchronization. The above results indicated that PSI under ankle alternating movements may be used as a new biomarker to evaluate the recovery of patients’ brain neurons.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629498","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629498","phase synchronization;stroke;ankle movements;Electroencephalography","Neuroplasticity;Neurons;Neural activity;Transforms;Stroke (medical condition);Electroencephalography;Physiology","Adult;Ankle;Brain;Cortical Synchronization;Electroencephalography;Humans;Stroke;United States","1","","15","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method ranks the EEG channels, such that the MI between the selected sensors and class labels is maximized. This selection criterion is known to reduce classification error. We employ a computationally efficient approach for MI estimation and EEG channel ranking. This approach is illustrated on EEG data recorded from three subjects performing two mental tasks.

Previous approaches primarily relied on supervised learning (SL), which may result in overfitting and reduced generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task collaborative network (MTCN) that integrates both SL and self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract more generalized EEG representations. The original SL task, i.e., the RSVP EEG classification task, is used to capture initial representations and establish classification thresholds for targets and non-targets. Two SSL tasks, including the masked temporal/spatial recognition task, are designed to enhance temporal dynamics extraction and capture the inherent spatial relationships among brain regions, respectively. The MTCN simultaneously learns from multiple tasks to derive a comprehensive representation that captures the essence of all tasks, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting and enhancing generalization performance. Moreover, to facilitate collaboration between SL and SSL, MTCN explicitly decomposes features into task-specific features and task-shared features, leveraging both label information with SL and feature information with SSL.

We propose a state-space model for explaining coupled dynamics of the source and EEG signals where EEG is a linear combination of sources according to the characteristics of volume conduction. Our model has a structure that the sparsity pattern of the model output matrix can indicate the position of active and inactive sources. With this assumption, the proposed estimation method consists of two steps. Firstly, a subspace identification method is performed to estimate the dynamic matrix of the model and the mapping matrix from the state variable to EEG output. Secondly, the estimation of the output matrix in the state-space model from the mapping matrix is solved by a group lasso problem to promote a sparsity pattern. As a result, nonzero rows of the output matrix represent active source that corresponding to EEG data. We verify the performance of our method on randomly generated data sets that represent realistic human brain activities in a fair setting. An acceptable accuracy of 95 - 98% is obtained with a suitable selection of a problem parameter and a thresholding process to discard small magnitudes of the output matrix.","2334-3052","978-1-5386-5724-9","10.1109/BMEiCON.2018.8609948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609948","Electroencephalography (EEG);Subspace identification;Group lasso","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Mathematical model;Estimation;State-space methods;Lead;Sensors","","4","","16","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the progress of many neuroscience studies is hindered by limitations in instrument size, portability, synchronous acquisition, and mobility. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes an integrated system comprising 112 fNIRS channels and 16 EEG channels. The characteristic of this system is its support for measurements under mobile conditions, and the scalable design of the sensor cap allows for flexible configuration of EEG and fNIRS sensors in different experiments. A corresponding upper computer software was developed to monitor brain activity in real-time. Noise and drift tests demonstrate that the instrument we designed meets the requirements for physiological signal acquisition. In visual evoked experiments, the local hemodynamic changes and visual evoked potentials of the subjects show good consistency with the experimental results reported in the literature, indicating that the proposed EEG–fNIRS acquisition system can simultaneously monitor both brain electrical activity and hemodynamic changes.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3337842","Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20190303043SF); “13th Five-Year Plan” Science and Technology Project of the Education Department of Jilin Province(grant numbers:JJKH20200964KJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10346987","Brain function monitoring;electroencephalography (EEG) sensors;EEG-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system;fNIRS sensors","Electroencephalography;Sensors;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Light sources;Monitoring;Detectors;Electrodes","","1","","32","IEEE","6 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Source localization remains a challenging task, one that is significantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and interference from spontaneous brain activity and sensor noise. Likewise, assessing the interactions between the individual sources, known as functional connectivity, is also confounded by noise and correlations in the sensor recordings. In addition, computational complexity has been an obstacle to computing functional connectivity. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for performing source localization with MEG and EEG data that includes noise and interference suppression.

GSCCA is a group sparse extension of the conventional CCA method to model the linear correlationship between emotional EEG class label vectors and the corresponding EEG feature vectors. In contrast to conventional CCA method or previous GSCCA methods, a major advantage of our GSCCA method is the ability of handling the group feature selection problem from raw EEG features, which makes it very suitable for simultaneously coping with both EEG emotion recognition and automatic channel selection issues where each EEG channel is associated with a group of raw EEG features. To deal with EEG emotion recognition problem, we adopt the popularly used frequency feature to describe the EEG signal by dividing the full EEG frequency band into five parts, i.e., δ, θ, α, β, and γ frequency bands, and then extract the frequency band features from each band for GSCCA model learning and emotion recognition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on EEG-based emotion recognition based on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GSCCA method would outperform the state-of-the-art EEG-based emotion recognition approaches.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2016.2587290","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB351704); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61231002,61572009); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20130020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505915","Channel selection;EEG-based emotion recognition;electroencephalogram (EEG);group sparse canonical correlation analysis (GSCCA)","Electroencephalography;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Frequency conversion;Frequency-domain analysis;Correlation;Brain modeling","","227","","25","IEEE","6 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequently, in order to not be restricted to short transient stimuli in event-related paradigms, we translated the idea of an objective listening effort estimation to the ongoing EEG activity in arbitrary, non-event-related listening tasks. Here we could again quantify effortful listening by analyzing the circular organization of the ongoing instantaneous phase.

In post-stroke subjects, a decrease in LFOs activity has been observed in the acute phase of the disease with a subsequent re-emergence related to functional recovery. With the ultimate aim to develop a Brain-Computer Interface for post-stroke motor rehabilitation based on LFO, in this study we analyzed LFOs activity on electroencephalographic data (EEG) recorded in a sample of 9 healthy participants during the Motor Execution (ME) and the Motor Imagery (MI) of the finger extension task. We extracted the LFOs activity both in the source and in the scalp domains with the aim of evaluate the reproducibility of the results between domains and analyze the LFO power on the scalp in the MI finger extension task. The results suggest that (i) the LFOs can be observed during the ME of the proposed experimental task in the cortex domain, (ii) the sources’ LFOs activity is reproduced on the scalp level and (iii) the LFOs may be detected also on the scalp during the MI task.

First, participants took subjective electroencephalography (EEG) signals while playing the games, then took their self-assessments for labeling EEG signals based on Game rating. There were four categories of Games Boring (G1), Calm (G2), Horror(G3), and Funny(G4) in the dataset. We labeled the collected dataset in two ways: the dataset with the type of games and with the Self-assessment manikin. After that, we calculated mean and standard deviation (STD) from both types of EEG data. Based on the feature vector, we applied a machine-learning algorithm to classify the emotion of the subject for the game based on EEG data. Specifically, we have employed multinomial logistic regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithm with cross-validation. With the method, we achieved 99.80% of accuracy for SVM with STD and 99.00% for the MLR with the mean method. This accuracy is 3.91‒4.92% better than that of the existing work, which shows an improved understanding of MR and human emotion and helps understand better human emotion and the area of VR and MR, estimated willing emotion.

In this work, we present a method for early diagnoses of AD by creating a low-cost EEG device along with using a deep neural network that can classify the suspected patients into three classes: MCI patients, AD patients, and healthy patients. This is done using collecting brain wave signals using Electroencephalography (EEG) device during a 3 level N-Back working memory test. This is called event-related potential (ERP), later the data will be cut into small frames, FFT transformed to extract brainwave subbands (theta, alpha, and beta) and then projected to 2D images where it will be used in training convolution neural network for classification. Early detection of Alzheimer will reduce the progression of AD at early stages.

While prefrontal areas have been linked to the LPP, the manner of their involvement remains poorly understood. In this study, EEG-informed fMRI was applied to investigate the cortical areas that modulate the frontal LPP during emotion regulation. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI data were collected during reappraisal-based emotion regulation, with EEG data analyzed from 400-600ms after task onset. Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied to denoise the EEG signal and extract common features across trials for all subjects and conditions. Extracted features were then used as regressors in general linear model (GLM)-based fMRI analysis. Results indicate that the septum pellucidum, right insula and right subcallosal gyrus are involved in the modulation of the LPP amplitude in prefrontal regions, as it is seen during reappraisal.

Stress is specially difficult to manage for visually impaired people (VIP) as they can become easily stressed in unknown situations. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to detect stress as it basically represents the ongoing electrical signal changes in human brain. Literature shows that the stress detection techniques are mostly based on either time or frequency domain analysis. However, using either time or frequency domain analysis may not be sufficient to provide appropriate outcome for stress detection. Hence, in this paper a method is proposed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and short-term Fourier transform (STFT) are used to extract features considering spatio-temporal information from EEG signals. In the EMD, the signal is first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) representing a finite number of signals while maintaining the time domain and STFT is used to convert time domain to time-frequency domain. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to classify the stress of VIP in unfamiliar indoor environments. The performance of the proposed method is compared with a state-of-the-art technique for stress detection. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over the existing technique.","2160-1348","978-1-6654-1943-7","10.1109/ICMLC51923.2020.9469562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9469562","EMD;IMF;Stress;STFT;Beta band","Support vector machines;Heart rate;Time-frequency analysis;Fourier transforms;Empirical mode decomposition;Psychology;Feature extraction","","3","","21","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An oddball-paradigm based ERP experiment was designed, and the periodically interrupted stimuli were presented to participants in the ERP experiment. Meanwhile, participants were instructed to provide their subjective quality ratings of interrupted speech under the same interruption conditions. The experimental results showed that the degree of both interruption duty cycle and interruption rate affected the peak latency of mismatch negativity (MMN) of the collected ERP response, with a smaller MMN peak latency under conditions with a smaller interruption duty cycle or a larger interruption rate.

Research shows Alpha waves are predominantly observed in healthy relaxed individuals. Since anxiety and stress are major emotional contents of human beings, the goal of this experiment is to assess the means of relaxation and concentration using Alpha music, which influence the alpha and beta rhythms significantly. For each subject, three EEG recordings were taken. One before the alpha music stimulus, one after 6 minutes of Alpha music and the last towards the end of alpha music. There was an increase in the maximum amplitudes of Alpha waves either after 6 minutes or after 12 minutes of alpha music. However, the maximum amplitude of beta waves showed a decline of up to 40% from the initial value. The standard deviation of both Alpha and Beta waves are almost stable between the mid and final recording. These results, namely, the increase in Alpha activity and decrease in Beta activity indicate that subjects experience `relaxed alertness'.

It is hypothesised a predictable singularity avoidance strategy is preferred in pHRC as humans tend to maximise predictability when using complex systems. By using an electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to assess the predictability of a task through a feature found in event-related potentials (ERP) and called prediction-error negativity (PEN). In this paper, two research questions are addressed. Can a complex pHRC singularity avoidance strategy generate a detectable PEN? Are PEN and human preferences related when comparing different control settings in a singularity avoidance strategy?

Compared with previous studies that used circular figures as common stimuli, herein, we ensured a higher evoked response by using individual face image stimulation. Imperceptible stimuli were confirmed by changing the image intensity and presenting a high-speed stimulation. Individual imperceptible face image stimulation confirmed that the following event-related potential (ERP) components: N 170, N 250, and N 400 were obtained.

In this paper, WSE was applied for EEG of ICU patients to study its prognostic value. During their stay in ICU, EEG was recorded from 20 patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For the analysis, the patients were divided into subgroups of poor outcome (persistent vegetative state, N=4) and good outcome (regain of consciousness, N=16). WSE for each 5-sec segment of EEG was calculated and also the average of WSE for each hour. Also, similar results were calculated for EEG powers in the bands 16-32 Hz and 1-60 Hz to be used as references. The statistical analysis was made by comparing the medians of the distributions of average WSE of each hour between poor and good outcome groups. The median of WSE of poor outcome group was significantly lower than that of good outcome group. The reference indicators did not show significant differences between the groups. The results suggest that WSE can be a valuable prognostic indicator for detecting the patients with poor outcome.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352973","","Detectors;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Cardiac arrest;Hospitals;Ischemic pain;Gas insulated transmission lines;Entropy;Statistical analysis;Surgery","Algorithms;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Heart Arrest;Heart Arrest;Humans;Intensive Care;Prognosis;Reproducibility of Results;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Sensitivity and Specificity;Treatment Outcome","2","","9","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional methods for EEG source estimation usually assume a few dipoles as sources of brain activities, but this is not always true for practical brain activities. Therefore, the proposed method estimates the dipole distribution on a specific layer of the cerebral cortex by using sulcus and gyrus region models. These models are based on the anatomical structure of cerebral cortex, particulalrly the pyramidal cell layer. They are also based on a priori knowledge that sensory evoked activity is restricted to the appropriate sensory and association areas of the cerebral cortex such as motor, visual and auditory cortexes. The cerebral cortex model was applied to a three-layer concentric head model consisting of the brain, skull and scalp. The dipole distribution was then estimated by the Moore-Penrose inverse method and by the searching method for all points. In order to evaluate the basic capability of the method, we demonstrated the estimation procedure by computing inverse solutions for sources located within a conducting area. Simulation results and an example EEG analysis indicate that this method and the models were able to discern concentric activities on one layer in the human brain model.","1094-687X","0-7803-6465-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2000.897978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897978","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Cerebral cortex;Data visualization;Anatomical structure;Skull;Scalp;Inverse problems;Computational modeling;Analytical models","","","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Elevated temperature can cause tachycardia (an increase in heart rate), as the body attempts to dissipate heat through vasodilation, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. In addition, the hypothalamus triggers sweating in order to regulate body temperature; that can culminate in fluid and electrolyte loss, which could impact metabolic processes and blood pressure. A prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and other ailments including organ damage and systemic dysfunction. Existing electroencephalography (EEG)-based heat-induced stress detection often considers the entire EEG frequency range (delta to gamma), concealing redundant and lossy information and increasing the likelihood of false detection rates. To address the limitations of conventional handcrafted feature engineering approaches in heat stress detection, this paper introduces MAESTRO, a novel model comprising two blocks: Convolutional and Multi-head Attention. The Convolutional block extracts precise information from individual EEG frequency bands, while the Multi-head Attention block enhances feature representation through attention mechanism. Finally, two dense layers are employed to classify heat stress into three classes: Acute, Chronic, and Control. The proposed framework undergoes validation using EEG data obtained from 40 rodents in a simulated laboratory environment. The outcomes illustrate the viability of the method in classifying heat-induced stress, yielding remarkable results for overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 98.88 %, 98.54 %, 98. 67 %, and 98.60 %, respectively.","2767-1097","979-8-3315-0546-2","10.1109/CSITSS64042.2024.10816769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816769","EEG;Heat-induced stress;Convolutional block;Multi-head attention block;CNN","Heating systems;Accuracy;Convolution;Rodents;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electrolytes;Electroencephalography;Data models;Stress","","","","16","IEEE","1 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model achieves an average classification accuracy of 78.48% on the miniature aVEP dataset, which is 1.14% higher than the previous state-of-the-art model, DCPM. Through comparison with other deep learning models in terms of parameter count, computational complexity, and classification accuracy, it is evident that the proposed model surpasses them in all these aspects The results suggest that the CNN model proposed in this study achieves high classification accuracy while demanding fewer computational resources. Although the network model we proposed is very simple, it can achieve good results in processing miniature aVEP. In future research, we will continue to improve this lightweight network to enhance its decoding performance for miniature aVEP.","2377-9322","979-8-3503-2299-6","10.1109/CIVEMSA58715.2024.10586646","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10586646","Brain-computer interface (BCI);asymmetric visual evoked potential (aVEP);lightweight network;convolutional neural networks (CNN)","Deep learning;Visualization;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Virtual environments;Brain modeling","","","","9","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims to investigate change of salivary biomarkers responding to stress and to develop real-time automated stress evaluation algorithm using EEG. Eight participants were included to receive entire mouth dental scaling. Saliva samples were collected before and after intervention while EEG signal was recorded along dental procedure with self-trigger button to mark stress events. ELISA technique was performed to evaluate biomarkers’ activities. Neural network was developed for stress classification. No significance occurred with salivary cortisol and salivary α-amylase, but sIgA showed due to period of acute stress over 10 minutes. Highest accuracy of the model was around 74% but true positive classification of stressed data was 46% due to small dataset of stressed data.

There is no single view on the nature and structure of emotional burnout. Boyko's psychological construct of Emotional Burnout (EB) defines Syndrome as a mechanism of psychological defense in the form of complete or partial excluding of emotions in response to traumatic influences and includes three key stages: Anxiety Tension, Resistance, and Exhaustion. The neurophysiological mechanisms of emotional burnout remain insufficiently studied. Establishing burnout-specific changes in brain activity is necessary to understand the phenomenon of burnout and distinguish it from other emotional mental disorders. Defining the EEG markers of burnout was our aim. 752 volunteers, first-fifth year students from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv aged 18 to 26 years participated in this study. EEG was recorded during the resting state (3 min, closed eyes condition) monopolarly using EEG 23-channel system Neurocom. To establish EEG correlates of emotional burnout during rest state we used special software written in Python 3.6 to implement Power Spectral Density calculation, the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric average coherence and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). We analyzed separate artifact-free EEG segments in all frequency bands from 0.2 to 45 Hz. Psychological testing was performed before the registration of EEG. To determine the formation of emotional burnout Boyko's “Syndrome of emotional burnout” Inventory was used. The Exhaustion phase of emotional burnout was formed in 79 participants, and it was under development in 213 participants. In background EEG activity during the development of the Exhaustion phase of emotional burnout variations in EEG spatial synchronization were observed in low- and high-frequency EEG components and includes the formation of two separate networks of functional connections: interhemispheric prefrontal, anterior frontal, and frontal links (alpha and gamma low bands) and parietal-occipital links (alpha and gamma high bands). DFA describes the long-term temporal correlations in the cortex, which are involved in different aspects of brain functioning. We detected a high resting state DFA scaling exponent values (up to 0.90-0,95) under exhaustion development in the alpha 1 (left temporal, parietal area), alpha 2 (right frontal area), alpha3 (posterior regions). Obtained values of DFA exponent and average coherence suggest the exhaustion formation is accompanied by the changes in visual and verbal processing, emotional processes (discretion and analysis).","","978-83-956020-7-8","10.23919/SPSympo57300.2023.10302682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10302682","Emotional burnout;Exhaustion;Detrended Fluctuation Analysis;Power Spectral Density;Functional connectivity","Visualization;Brain;Fluctuations;Time series analysis;Psychology;Coherence;Electroencephalography","","","","31","","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, the multi-dimensional conditional mutual information method was used to extract the frequency band features of the EEG data. And the coupling features under the combination of multi-frequency bands were transformed into multi-spectral images. At the same time, the idea of Densenet was introduced to improve the multi-scale convolutional neural network. Firstly, according to the discreteness of multispectral EEG image features, two-scale convolution kernels were used to calculate and learn useful channel and frequency band feature information in multispectral image data. Secondly, to enhance feature propagation and reduce the number of parameters, the dense network was connected after the multi-scale convolutional network, and the learning rate change function of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm was optimized to objectively evaluate the training effect. The experimental results showed that compared with the classical convolution neural network (CNN) and multi-scale convolution neural network, the proposed MHCNN had better classification performance in the six frequency band combinations with the highest accuracy of 98%: Theta-Alpha2-Gamma, Alpha2-Beta2-Gamma, Beta1-Beta2-Gamma, Theta-Beta2-Gamma, Theta- Alpha1-Gamma, and Alpha1-Alpha2-Gamma. By comparing the classification results of six frequency band combinations, it was found that the combination of the Theta-Beta2-Gamma band had the best classification effect.

The extensive development of online teaching modes such as MOOC has provided massive amounts of learning behavior data for educational researchers. In order to increase the attention of MOOC learners and achieve better teaching results, teachers need to rationally design MOOC courses from multiple dimensions such as teaching content, courseware design, and learner psychology.The rapid development of brain science research is constantly injecting new vitality into the reform of teaching methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement of the electrical activity generated when neurons in the brain emit electrical signals synchronously. In specially designed experiments, a large number of the same stimuli will usually appear repeatedly, and the event-related potential (ERP) can be extracted by averaging the EEG data segments and superimposing them together. ERP is the direct result of specific sensory or cognitive events, and it is the response of the brain that can be measured. Therefore, it has been widely used in various research fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology. ERP also has important applications in brain-computer interface. In this study the best state of MOOC learning is explored from the perspective of brain cognition. We obtain and measure the induced brain waves with or without novel stimulus, then analyze the extract ERP component and conduct discriminatory analysis. We design relevant eye movement experiments and EEG experiments to obtain eye movement data and EEG data. Through analysis and comparison, under various learning load levels, we find the relationship between the MOOC course design method and the attention of MOOC learners. Further discuss how to rationally design courses to improve students' learning effects.In this study we discuss the teaching reform methods that teachers should adopt in MOOC teaching, design efficient course introduction methods, stimulate learners' positive emotions, transform teaching methods as novel stimulus, enable learners to jump through the trough of thinking and increase their alertness. Related experiments verify the effectiveness of these methods and provide an effective way to improve the teaching quality of MOOC courses.","2688-0938","978-1-7281-7687-1","10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326986","MOOC;Electroencephalogram (EEG);Eye tracking technology;ERP (Event-related potential);novel stimulus","Education;Electronic learning;Computer aided instruction;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Gaze tracking;Videos","","1","","10","IEEE","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A group of 15 healthy volunteers participated in the study; EEG recordings were performed at baseline (closed-eyes resting-state without VR), and during the participants’ navigation within four immersive nVRs, three designed to elicit the profound feeling of awe and one of reference. To unveil the neural underpinnings associated with awe experiences, linear and nonlinear frequency analyses, Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Power Spectral Entropy (PSE), were computed for each 2-second EEG signal epoch within four main EEG frequency bands. The Friedman test was applied to each channel to compare (i) awe-inducing vs. reference nVRs, highlighting the effect of awe, and (ii) reference nVRs vs. baseline condition, highlighting the effect of VR. The Friedman test results (p<0.01) showed that both PSD and PSE captured similar patterns within the comparison reference nVRs vs. baseline. In contrast, greater differences between the two methods were found in the awe-inducing vs. reference nVRs comparison, showing PSD and PSE changes that were specific to each awe-inducing nVRs.

However, the classification of the training signals into item classes is not always accurate because of the fact that they are based on EEG signals and the data is high dimensionality and complexity. This research work develops an original algorithm incorporating the PCA and template matching models for accurate EEG indicator organization in seizure recognition. PCA is used to transform the EEG signals into a space where relevant features are retained, and noise is minimized. Then, the signals are classified by using template matching technique with seizure and non-seizure templates. The integration of these two methods improves the detection performance and reduces the computational time when analysing a large amount of seizure data as shown from the experimental outcomes using benchmark EEG data. The approach proposed here has potential for real time seizure monitoring and can provide potential avenue towards enhanced clinical diagnosis and patient care.","","979-8-3503-6894-9","10.1109/IHCSP63227.2024.10959978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10959978","EEG signal classification;seizure detection;Principal Component Analysis (PCA);template matching;dimensionality reduction;real-time monitoring;epilepsy;brain activity","Accuracy;Sensitivity;Epilepsy;Pattern classification;Transforms;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Discrete wavelet transforms;Reliability;Principal component analysis","","","","20","IEEE","16 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The device tested in this paper is called the Emotiv EPOC headset, which is an electroencephalograph (EEG) measuring device and enables the measuring of brain activity using 14 strategically placed sensors. This paper presents: 1) a BCI framework driven completely by thought patterns, aimed at real world applications 2) a quantitative analysis of the performance of the implemented system. The Emotiv EPOC headset based BCI framework presented in this paper was tested on a problem of controlling a simple differential wheeled robot by identifying four thought patterns in the user: “neutral”, “move forward”, “turn left”, and “turn right”. The developed approach was tested on 6 individuals and the results show that while BCI control of a mobile robot is possible, precise movement required to guide a robot along a set path is difficult with the current setup. Furthermore, intense concentration is required from users to control the robot accurately.","2158-2254","978-1-4673-5637-4","10.1109/HSI.2013.6577809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577809","Brain Computer Interface;Emotiv EPOC;EEG;Differential Wheel Robot","Mobile robots;Headphones;Electroencephalography;Brain;Training;Sensors","","13","","29","IEEE","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method of signal acquisition is non-invasive, resulting in significant data loss and artifacts that must be reduced. In order to do this, a quantification method using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Root Mean Square (RMS) for feature extraction are applied to improve the quality of the signal reception.

EEG (Electroencephalography) technique has been used extensively as a non-invasive BCI solution for brain activity study. Many psychological work has suggested that human brains can generate some recognizable EEG signals associated with some specific activities. This paper suggests a novel EEG recognition method, i.e. Segmented EEG Graph using PLA (SEGPA), that incorporates improved Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) algorithm and EEG-based weighted network for EEG pattern recognition, which can be used for machinery control. The improved PLA algorithm and EEG-based weighted network technique incorporates the data sampling and segmentation method.

Particularly, we evaluated the effect of happiness and fear HBO on the amplitude of ERP waveforms elicited by neutral face processing. In addition, we evaluated the subjective valence and arousal perception of the presented neutral faces by means of the self-assessment-manikin test. We observed a significant increase in the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) for central left sites (i.e., C3) during the administration of HBOs with respect to clean air. On the other hand, we did not observe any significant change in the subjective valence and arousal scores as well as for the early components of the ERP (i.e., P100, N170, Vertex-Positive-Potential). Our preliminary results suggest that fear and happiness HBO can induce a protracted increase in the LPP, and possibly reflect an automatic and sustained engagement with emotionally significant content.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871495","Italian MIUR (i.e., Ministry of Education and Research); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871495","","Physiology;Electroencephalography;Behavioral sciences;Faces","Body Odor;Evoked Potentials;Facial Recognition;Fear;Female;Happiness;Healthy Volunteers;Humans","3","","34","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The assessment of the effective connectivity (EC) of the brain and its impact on the detection and medication of neurodegenerative pathophysiology is hence a crucial concern that needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, there are no clinically certain diagnostic biomarkers that can be linked to SAD. Therefore, investigating neural connectivity biomarkers of SAD based on deep learning models (DL) has a promising approach with its recent underlined potential results. In this study, an electroencephalography (EEG)-based detection model for SAD is constructed through directed causal influences combined with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM). The EEG data were classified by applying three different DL models, namely, CNN, LSTM, and CNN + LSTM to discriminate the severity of SAD (severe, moderate, mild) and healthy controls (HC) at different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, low beta, and high beta) in the default mode network (DMN) under resting-state condition. The DL model uses the EC features as input, which are derived from the cortical correlation within different EEG rhythms for certain cortical areas that are more susceptible to SAD. Experimental results revealed that the proposed model (CNN + LSTM) outperforms the other models in SAD recognition. For our dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 92.86%, 92.86%, 96.43%, and 89.29%, specificities of 95.24%, 95.24%, 100%, and 90.91%, and sensitivities of 85.71%, 85.71%, 87.50%, and 83.33% were achieved by using CNN + LSTM model for severe, moderate, mild, and HC, respectively. The fundamental contribution of this analysis is the characterization of neural brain features using different DL models to categorize the severity of SAD, which can represent a potential biomarker for SAD.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089358","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Higher Institutional Centre of Excellence (HICoE) Scheme awarded to Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR); Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS(grant numbers:YUTP-FRG 015LC0-292); Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Medicine Perak, Kuala Lumpur University, under Approval(grant numbers:UniKLRCMP/MREC/2019/065); Helsinki Declaration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454451","Effective connectivity network;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);social anxiety disorder (SAD);default mode network (DMN);deep learning models;partial directed coherence (PDC);electroencephalogram (EEG);human brain mapping","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models;Biomarkers;Biological system modeling;Task analysis;Regulation","","20","","75","CCBY","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
