However, psychophysical and electrophysiological tests, routinely used for diagnosis, are often not sufficient for detection of olfactory loss. In this study, chemosensory evoked electroencephalography (EEG) signals were characterized via brain-computer interface feature extraction methods to classify Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals. Results showed that combining EEG features and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores commonly used for diagnosis of olfactory loss, achieved a conspicuous success rate of nearly 92% in diagnosis. The findings suggest that the proposed approach can be considered as a new strategy for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease","2165-0608","979-8-3503-4355-7","10.1109/SIU59756.2023.10223913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10223913","Chemosensory brain responses;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Alzheimer's Disease;Support vector machine","Alzheimer's disease;Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Entropy;Brain-computer interfaces;Aging;Oscillators","","2","","","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Neurological diseases are commonly characterized by a loss of olfactory sensation. Getting proper treatment for these neurologic diseases at an early stage increases the chances of recovery. A patient often is not able to comprehend the loss of olfactory perception in the early stages of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. In order to identify olfactory sensory loss early, deep learning frameworks can be very useful. The main objective of our study is to build a deep learning-based model for classifying five different aromatic stimuli, i.e., no smell, rose water's smell, perfume's smell, cinnamon's smell, and odonil's smell using the EEG signals of subjects. In this paper, an Attention mechanism-based 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture has been introduced. The designed model successfully classified five types of olfactory stimuli using EEG signals with 97.92% accuracy. The study is novel in two respects, i.e., i) appending attention mechanism to the designed 1D CNN model to improve its performance, and ii) analyzing changes occurring in different brain regions in response to different olfactory stimuli.","","979-8-3503-2732-8","10.1109/C2I659362.2023.10430936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10430936","CNN;Olfactory Perception Classification;EEG","Neurological diseases;Olfactory;Psychology;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks;Monitoring","","5","","18","IEEE","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper proposes a simple feature extraction technique to detect the N400 signal from the captured electroencephalographic waveform and an Interval type-2 Fuzzy Classifier is then designed to classify the learning levels using the extracted features. The paper also proposes a way to detect the early Alzheimer and schizophrenic patients using an event-related potential named N400. Here it is shown that the repetition effect of the N400 signal is different for the Alzheimer patients and healthy person. An N400 peak is noticed for both the Alzheimer patients and the healthy person but the amplitude of the curve is different for two different cases. The other aspect of this present work reveals that the increased latency of N400 signal can help us to detect a schizophrenic patient.","","978-1-5386-2238-4","10.1109/ICCCI.2018.8441387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8441387","olfactory memory;N400;event-related potential;electroencephalography;interval type 2 fuzzy classifier","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Electrodes;Olfactory;Task analysis","","8","","25","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper, explains the brain activity observed, if loss of smell (Olfaction) persists. If the symptoms are treated as early biomarker will enable earlier diagnosis and preventative treatments of syndromes. The proposed framework suggests a portable, easy to deploy noninvasive method to detect olfactory dysfunctions at the COVID test center. The validation of the parameters under clinical expertise has laid a ground to predict and proper assess of olfactory deficits in a patient within 20 minutes. The selection of hyper parameters was done using RBF kernel. The test is steered using a simple neuro-imaging, non-invasive device gathering the EBG waves, essentially gamma waves received from the olfactory nerve present in the upper nostril. The results impress to establish a base, that a decreased sense of smell may be a pointer to patients in the initial stage of the syndrome. The statistical validator, Fisher’s exact test is performed for data analyses taken from neuroimaging device. The statistical significance was defined as P < .05 for the anosmia (loss of smell). The P- value calculated through our experimental setup is 0.008 for anosmia proved as a significant factor for the detection of infection.","","978-1-6654-6756-8","10.1109/ICIEM54221.2022.9853059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853059","SARS-CoV2;Olfaction;Neuro-imaging device;COVID-19 positive;EBG","COVID-19;Neuroimaging;Training;Support vector machines;Brain;Systematics;Olfactory","","","","28","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the importance of detecting these early biomarkers for timely intervention, this letter proposes the novel use of chemosensory EEG for the early detection of PD, as it captures the brain's responses to olfactory stimuli, one of the primary sensory modalities affected by the disease. The proposed method employs an Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) to decompose EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Entropic features, including approximate entropy (AEn), sample entropy (SEn), and Rényi permutation entropy (RpEn), are extracted from these IMFs to identify distinguishing characteristics. These features are then evaluated using several machine learning classifiers. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that combining RpEn features with Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier achieves optimal performance, with an accuracy of 96.47%, a precision of 96.14%, and a kappa score of 0.95.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2025.3565312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979890","Parkinson's Disease;chemosensory EEG;olfactory dysfunction;ICEEMDAN;entropy features;machine learning","Electroencephalography;Entropy;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Diseases;Support vector machines;Random forests;Time series analysis;Complexity theory","","","","","IEEE","29 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this way, many diseases can be diagnosed early and treatment processes can be closely monitored. On the one hand, the advancing technology allows us to demonstrate how the human brain reacts to various environmental stimuli. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) technique was used to record the reactions of the brain to the imagination of cloves and mint odors. The distinguishability of brain responses to these odors was tested using pixel means of gray-level images obtained from Burg-based color spectrogram images. By using pixel means as an attribute, a classification accuracy of 82.5% was obtained with k-nearest neighbor. The results showed that the EEG signals that can occur when the brain imagines different odors can be distinguished.","2165-0608","978-1-7281-7206-4","10.1109/SIU49456.2020.9302244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302244","odor;electroencephalogram;close;mint;classification;feature extraction","Electroencephalography;Sleep;Olfactory;Deep learning;Biosensors;Biomedical monitoring;Alzheimer's disease","","1","","","IEEE","7 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
