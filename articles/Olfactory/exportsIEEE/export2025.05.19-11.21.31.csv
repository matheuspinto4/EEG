Brain waves are in necessitating to eradicate noises and to extract the valuable features. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a functional pattern classification technique which is trained all the way through the error Back-Propagation algorithm. In this paper in order to classify the mental tasks, the brain signals are trained using neural network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Artificial Neural Network. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dominant tool for analyzing data and finding patterns in it. In Principal Component Analysis, data compression is possible and it projects higher dimensional data to lower dimensional data. By using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network, the redundant data in the dataset is eliminated first and the obtained data is trained using Neural Network. EEG data for five cognitive tasks from five subjects are taken from the Colorado University database. Pattern classification is applied for the data of all tasks of one subject using Neural Network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network.

EEGs are up-and-coming as a vital methodology to suit the increasing global demand for more affordable and effectual clinical and healthcare services, with fitting interpretation methods. This research paper presents an automated system for efficient detection of brain tumors in EEG signals using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The ANN employed in the proposed system is feedforward backpropagation neural network. Generally, the EEG signals are bound to contain an assortment of artifacts from both subject and equipment interferences along with essential information regarding abnormalities and brain activity (responses to certain stimuli). Initially, adaptive filtering is applied to remove the artifacts present in the EEG signal. Subsequently, generic features present in the EEG signal are extracted using spectral estimation. Specifically, spectral analysis is achieved by using Fast Fourier Transform that extracts the signal features buried in a wide band of noise. The clean EEG data thus obtained is used as training input to the feedforward backpropagation neural network. The trained feedforward backpropagation neural network when fed with a test EEG signal, effectively detects the presence of brain tumor in the EEG signal.

Different physiological signals are commonly used to measure the human thermal comfort. Among them, the EEG is one of the most promising given its strong relationship with mental state, that is correlated to thermal perception. EEG brainwaves are used as features to detect human thermal comfort. However previous research did not turn out to identify a set of features with the same level of correlation with the thermal comfort. The reason of that relies on the fact that different experiments used different references, such as thermal comfort, thermal sensation, or environmental temperature. Moreover, brainwaves are influenced also by other human factors that lead to low accuracies. This paper presents a novel approach for EEG signal processing, coupled with a new labelling method of human thermal perception. A commercial 4-channels EEG wearable device has been used to collect the brain activity of 52 subjects exposed to different thermal conditions (cold, neutral and warm). The subjective thermal perception has been also collected using a common questionnaire based on 3 scores: thermal comfort, thermal sensation and thermal preference. After signal pre-processing, a short-time windowing technique has been applied to the cleaned EEG signal and a set of statistical, time-frequency, log-covariance and other features have been calculated to analyse the signal pattern. The dataset has been labelled using a parameter that is the result of a permutation and combination analysis applied to the 3 scores collected with the questionnaires. Finally, an artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron - MLP) has been trained to predict thermal label using the EEG signal as unique input. The model achieved an accuracy of 90% in the prediction of 5 different levels of thermal perception, demonstrating the high potential of the proposed approach.","","979-8-3503-8501-4","10.1109/MetroLivEnv60384.2024.10615866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10615866","wearable sensors;personal comfort models;thermal comfort;EEG signal processing;artificial neural network","Temperature sensors;Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Temperature;Artificial neural networks;Signal processing;Brain modeling","","","","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advancements such as brain-to-speech or brain-to-image technology aim to reconstruct speech from neural activity. However, robust decoding of communication-related paradigms, such as imagined speech and visual imagery, using non-invasive techniques still remains challenging. This study analyzes brain dynamics in these two paradigms by examining neural synchronization and functional connectivity through phase-locking values (PLV) in noninvasively collected EEG data. Results show that visual imagery produces higher PLV values in visual cortex, engaging spatial networks, while imagined speech demonstrates consistent synchronization, primarily engaging language-related regions. These findings suggest that imagined speech is suitable for language-driven BCI applications, while visual imagery can complement BCI systems for users with speech impairments. Furthermore, the brain connectivity results implies that personalized calibration is crucial for optimizing BCI performance.","2572-7672","979-8-3315-2192-9","10.1109/BCI65088.2025.10931355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10931355","brain-computer interface;electroencephalogram;imagined speech;signal processing;visual imagery","Visualization;Communication systems;Neural activity;Signal processing;Motors;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Calibration;Synchronization;Speech processing","","","","22","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the dataset simulation section, we dealt with the EEG forward problem by using the 3-shell realistic head model and the boundary element method (BEM). The cortical functional atlas were used to provide physiological constraints. The nonlinear difference equation was used to simulate the brain information. In the neural network training section, we simulated a large amount of EEG-cortex training data. The prior information in weight layers and nonlinear connections was stored using supervised learning.

The standardized raw EEG data is subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation; the ratio-cut is applied to preserve 99% of the explained variance. Conversely, the fMRI data is processed as single point brain activations aggregated at fMRI time resolution $\delta_{t,fMRI}$. Each set of PCA transformed EEG features is aligned with the explained brain activation. The processed data is then trained using a Polynomial Regression model of degree (d = 4). The predictive power of each of the principal component in capturing the explained brain activation is quantified in terms of Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) and Mean Squared Errors (MSEs). The recorded {MAEs, MSEs} reflect that the principal components are causally related to explained brain activations and demonstrate consistent performance over the range of principal components introduced as a result of ratio-cut method. The MAEs for each of the task i.e. {rest, sleep} are closely spaced between {0.35-0.60}; this implies that a single principal component cannot disproportionately detect brain activation(s). Moreover, the diff{MAE} is higher than diff{MSE} for higher principal components that points to prediction difficulty in sleep state-potentially driving the error values to the down-side. The proposed study bridges gaps in the existing literature by introducing new insights in multi-modal signal processing and neuroimaging. The findings in this study can be of significant importance in prediction modeling of clinically relevant data in neurological patient care pathways.","","979-8-3315-3149-2","10.1109/IDAP64064.2024.10710881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10710881","principal component analysis (pca);electroencephalography (eeg);functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri);supervised learning;signal processing;polynomial regression","Training;Sleep;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Signal processing;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models;Speech processing;Principal component analysis","","","","15","IEEE","16 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Functional connectivity between different temporal states is determined by the visibility between the vector’s norm and the norm of its projections onto subsequent time states. To create a weighted vector visibility graph using the connections among the nodes, it presents edge weights between the nodes using Gaussian kernels. The MI task-based WVV graph is then used to obtain GSP-based spectral features of Laplacian energy (LE) and Fiedler vector energy (FE).

Motor imagery does not require external stimulation and is one of the most widely used BCI paradigms, and is now widely used to address the treatment of neurological impairments such as paralysis, stroke, and acromegaly. Electrophysiological source imaging is a technique based on the observation of electromagnetic signals from the cerebral cortex, reflecting the electrophysiological activity of brain nerve cells on the scalp surface of the brain. The wavelet transform, on the other hand, is commonly used for the processing of non-smooth signals and aims to extract excellent signal features. This paper combines these two algorithms as feature extraction methods. In recent years, deep learning has been increasingly combined with MI-EEG-based BCI. GoogLeNet is one of the most classical convolutional neural networks and has made a splash in ImageNet image recognition. However, using GoogLeNet to train the BCI public dataset BCI IV IIa and dataset HGD has shown problems such as long training time, overfitting, and gradient disappearance. In response, this paper proposes an improved and streamlined version of GoogLeNet for training based on this dataset to achieve an overall improvement in accuracy, training time, number of parameters, and other indicators.

To address these issues, this study proposes a novel dense connection convolutional neural network with spatio-temporal feature fusion to classify brain visual images. Drawing inspiration from visual attention and brain memory mechanisms, a densely connected module is incorporated to mitigate the vanishing gradient issue and facilitate effective training of deep networks. EEG signals are subsequently encoded and stored along both temporal and spatial dimensions. To leveraging the unique properties of EEG signals, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit network is employed to derive temporal features, while spatial features are extracted using a two-dimensional mixed dilated convolution module.

Modelling of neural activities is probably more difficult than modelling the function of any other organ. Application of time– frequency (TF) domain analysis for detection of the seizure in neonates has paved the way for further research in this area. An EEG signal can be considered as the output of a nonlinear system, which may be characterized deterministically. Nonstationarity of the signals can be quantified by evaluating the changes in signal distribution over time. The synchro‐squeezing wavelet transform has been introduced as a post‐processing technique to enhance the TF spectrum obtained by applying the wavelet transform.

Through extensive evaluation of our model on the DEAP dataset, we show that the β-VAE architecture learns a compressed representation of the EEG signal in an unsupervised manner, and the reconstructed signal contains less artifact. We compare our proposed method with different baselines and state-of-the-art techniques for EEG signal denoising, demonstrating significantly reduced reconstruction error under artificially induced noise. The results suggest that our approach has great potential for improving the analysis and understanding of EEG signals in clinical and research settings.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782962","Deep Neural Network;Variational Autoencoder;Electroencephalogram;EEG Denoising;Artifact Removal","Training;Sensitivity;Noise reduction;Noise;Brain modeling;Probabilistic logic;Electroencephalography;Signal denoising;Noise measurement;Signal analysis","Electroencephalography;Humans;Algorithms;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Artifacts;Brain;Autoencoder","","","18","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the success of existing EEG approaches in brain state recognition studies, it is still challenging to differentiate brain states via explainable and generalizable deep learning approaches. In other words, how to explore meaningful and distinguishing features and how to overcome the huge variability and overfitting problem still need to be further studied. To alleviate these challenges, in this work, a multiple random fragment search-based multilayer recurrent neural network (MRFS-MRNN) is proposed to improve the differentiating performance and explore meaningful patterns. Specifically, an explainable MRNN module is proposed to capture the temporal dependences preserved in EEG time series. Besides, a MRFS module is designed to cut multiple random fragments from the entire EEG signal time course to improve the effectiveness of brain state differentiating ability. MRFS-MRNN is concatenatedto effectively overcome the huge variabilities and overfitting problems. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MRFS-MRNN model not only has excellent differentiating performance, but also has good explanation and generalization ability. The classification accuracies reach as high as 95.18% for binary classification and 89.19% for four-category classification on the individual level. Similarly, 95.53% and 85.84% classification accuracies are obtained for the binary and four-category classification on the group level. What’s more, 94.28% and 85.43% classification accuracies of binary and four-category classifications are achieved for predicting brand new subjects. The experiment results showed that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the same underlying data and improved the explanation and generalization ability.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3214225","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010110001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006194,61936007,82060336,42271315,62036011,U1801265); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0105702); The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3102019QD005); High-Level Researcher Start-Up Projects(grant numbers:06100-22GH0202178,G2022WD0246); Science and Technology Support Project of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:[2021]432); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2214050008706); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20220530161409021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940311","Differentiating brain states;electroencephalogram (EEG);multiple random fragment search (MRFS);recurrent neural network (RNN)","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Nonhomogeneous media;Feature extraction;Data models;Time series analysis","Humans;Electroencephalography;Neural Networks, Computer;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Algorithms;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Deep Learning","5","","65","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For humans, we used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to analyze neural responses to nouns and verbs when participants naturally listened to spoken narratives. For DNNs, we analyzed word embeddings from a transformer-based model, i.e., BERT, that reach human-level performance when trained to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks. A significant word class difference was observed in both the EEG responses and model representations. Further analyses revealed that the model representations could predict the EEG response difference between nouns and verbs.

LSTM and GRU are good at discovering the temporally related EEG sequences, while CNNs extract the spatial feature of raw EEG data very well. We model and analyze graph-structured data from functional brain networks using GIN, revealing insights into spatial dynamics and inter-channel connections. Both graph-based and spatiotemporal features are integrated as proposed in the framework, and a deep learning architecture is constructed for signal decoding and classification that allows for a higher signal decoding and classification accuracy.

During a focal seizure the epileptic activity spreads rapidly from the ictal onset region to neighboring brain areas. ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) is a commonly used technique to diagnose epilepsy. EEG has a high temporal resolution which allows us to investigate the dynamics of the underlying brain activity. Due to the rapid propagation of a seizure, the seizure can originate from a network of brain regions which are simultaneously active before being noticeable on the EEG. In this paper we investigate two state of the art source localization techniques, the Recursive Applied and Projected (RAP) and the pre-correlated and orthogonally projected (POP) multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, to identify the location of the driver behind the simulated epileptic brain network. Furthermore we investigate the applicability of connectivity analysis to identify the source driving the underlying brain network. We showed that the POP-MUSIC algorithm outperforms the RAP-MUSIC algorithm to identify the locations of the simultaneous brain activity. Furthermore, we showed the feasibility of identifying the driver behind a brain network by POP-MUSIC algorithm followed by connectivity analysis.","","978-1-4244-8281-8","10.1109/NFSI.2011.5936838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5936838","Electroencephalography;epilepsy;source localization;connectivity analysis","Electroencephalography;Algorithm design and analysis;Brain modeling;Driver circuits;Signal to noise ratio;Multiple signal classification","","","","12","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motor Imagery, part of BCI research field, aims to generate commands by imagining the movements of limbs without performing any real movement. So it is a state in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. The users provide training data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, and after the recording, different techniques and algorithms are used to learn patterns from the data in order to map them with a label or output. In this paper, we are interested to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this we show to our subject a video of a box that moves through a plane in three different directions, right, left, and forward. The mental task consists of imagining we are moving the box with our brain activity. Since embodiment provides greater accuracy in motor imagery, this kind of visual feedback, when there is no obvious congruity with any daily neural command, brings a greater difficulty than usual motor imagery. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a simple convolutional neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them. The network demonstrates the possibility to achieve meaningful accuracy for our object movement imagery.","2572-7672","978-1-7281-8485-2","10.1109/BCI51272.2021.9385319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385319","brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);motor imagery;convolutional neural networks;classification;visual feedback;embodiment","Training;Deep learning;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Robots","","3","","29","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is the task of blind source separation (BSS) to find the sources. However, the number of brain sources is generally larger than the number of mixtures, which leads to an underdetermined model with infinite solutions. Under the reasonable assumption that brain sources are sparse within a domain, e.g., in the spatial, time, or time-frequency domain, we may obtain the sources through sparse representation. As explained in this article, several other typical problems, e.g., feature selection in brain signal processing, can also be formulated as the underdetermined linear model and solved by sparse representation. This article first reviews the probabilistic results of the equivalence between two important sparse solutions - the 0-norm and 1-norm solutions. In sparse representation-based brain component analysis including blind separation of brain sources and electroencephalogram (EEG) inverse imaging, the equivalence is related to the recoverability of the sources. This article also focuses on the applications of sparse representation in brain signal processing, including components extraction, BSS and EEG inverse imaging, feature selection, and classification.

The instrument that connects brain commands to device movements is called an intermediate, one of which is an Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG captures brain signals by placing electrodes on the scalp and translating the recorded signals to external commands. In BCI, one of the variables that can be used is motor imagery (MI), where a person can control an external device by imagining its movements. EEG signal processing is important in BCI performance. There are feature extraction and classification. This paper proposed the Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to recognize BCI competition data sets. FBCSP is effective in MI recognition because it extracts frequency and spatial features. RNN is used for the classification by considering the data sequence of each spatial feature of FBCSP extraction.

One application of this technology consists of identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party-like scenario and activate speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). It has been shown that in CIs it is possible to decode selective attention, although the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI decrease the accuracy of linear decoders in comparison to NH subjects. The goal of this work was to investigate the use of non-linear models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve the selective attention decoding accuracy in CI users. The hypothesis is that a non-linear decoder may be able to better separate the electrical artifact from the neural responses. Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. Moreover, we show that a simple DNN architecture that directly classifies the locus of attention based on the EEG and a mixture of the incoming speech stream envelopes can be used to decode selective attention in CI users.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-6631-5","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054021","Cochlear implant;electroencephalography;EEG;selective attention;deep neural network","Cochlear implants;Neural networks;Speech enhancement;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Decoding","","2","","16","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zero-training BCI can be classified into a session-to-session transfer BCI and a subject-independent BCI. The session-to-session transfer BCI is characterized by high classification accuracy, but there is a limitation that the model could not be improved as the number of subjects increased. On the other hand, the subject-independent BCI has advantage in increasing the number of subjects, but had the problem of requiring too many subjects for high accuracy. In this study, we proposed the hybrid zero-training BCI that integrates the advantages of the aforementioned two methods and Multidomain CNN that combined time-, spatial-, and phase-domain, and aimed for more practical application and higher classification accuracy. We collected three-class MI EEG data related to lower-limb movement (gait, sit-down, and rest) from three subjects with three sessions per subject. The classification accuracy of the proposed method (82.10 ±10.66%) in the classification of three-class of MI tasks was significantly higher than that of the existing zero-training BCIs (66.42 ±9.68%, 66.67±6.83%) I, and also higher than the conventional BCI (70.86±9.46%) that trains and evaluates with training sessions collected on the same day although not statistically significant.","2572-7672","978-1-7281-8485-2","10.1109/BCI51272.2021.9385316","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:2017-0-00432); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385316","Brain-Computer interface;EEG;Motor imagery;Zero-training;Convolutional neural network","Training;Brain modeling;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Biological neural networks","","5","","16","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is complicated because these signals are usually case-specific and distinct models must be trained for each subject to process and classify his/her EEG signals. Moreover, in BCI systems EEG signals are processed online, so the time latency must be very low. In this paper, we have proposed a method based on signal-to-image conversion to investigate image processing techniques in the pair-wise classification of motor and mental imagery EEG signals. We first decomposed EEG signals of each trial into four sub-bands. Then, for each sub-band, we converted EEG time series to 2-dimensional (2D) images using covariance between signals of all channels. Then, statistical, textural and PCA-based features were extracted from these images and fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Near infrared probes were aligned with C3 and C4, and EEG electrodes were placed midway between the NIRS probes. NIRS and EEG signals were acquired from six healthy subjects during six imagined hand clenching force and speed tasks involving the right hand. The results showed that NIRS combined with EEG is effective for simultaneously measuring brain activity of the sensorimotor area. The study also showed that in the duration of (0, 10) s for imagined force and speed of hand clenching, HbO first exhibited a negative variation trend, which was followed by a negative peak. After the negative peak, it exhibited a positive variation trend with a positive peak about 6-8 s after termination of imagined movement. During (-2, 1) s, the EEG may have indicated neural processing during the preparation, execution, and monitoring of a given imagined force and speed of hand clenching. The instantaneous phase, frequency, and amplitude feature of the EEG were calculated by Hilbert transform; HbO and the difference between HbO and Hb concentrations were extracted. The features of NIRS and EEG were combined to classify three levels of imagined force [at 20/50/80% MVGF (maximum voluntary grip force)] and speed (at 0.5/1/2 Hz) of hand clenching by SVM. The average classification accuracy of the NIRS-EEG fusion feature was 0.74 ± 0.02.

These factors make it challenging to accurately classify EEG signals as normal or abnormal. However, the classification task can be made more manageable by using brain network representation of EEG signals. Brain network representation allows for the creation of a graph-based model of the functional connectivity of the human brain, which can be used to recognize important patterns and features in the EEG signals that are relevant to specific brain activities or conditions.

This study advocates the utilization of one of the most advanced generative models, the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), for the artificial synthesis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) raw signals. The quality of the generated EEG signals is evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Through dimensionality reduction projection, we observed a notable similarity in the data distributions between the generated EEG signals and real EEG signals. Additionally, spectral analysis indicates a striking similarity in energy distribution between the two, accompanied by the presence of an event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon in the generated EEG signals. Quantitative analysis reveals that the accuracy of generated EEG signals for left and right-hand motor imagery tasks is 89.81 ± 2.11%, with discriminative information related to classes predominantly concentrated in the motor-sensory cortex area and alpha-beta frequency band. Furthermore, the integration of generated EEG samples contributes to a 3.17% improvement in the classification performance of BCI-deficiency subjects. These artificially generated EEG signals exhibit promising potential for application in calibrating MI-BCI deep learning models, thereby alleviating the burden on participants.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782900","Brain-computer interface;motor imagery;de-noising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM);BCI-deficiency","Training;Statistical analysis;Noise reduction;Diffusion models;Motors;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Synchronization;Spectral analysis","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Algorithms;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Motor Cortex","","","17","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite numerous promising solutions, electrooculography (EOG) recording or an eye-blink detection algorithm is required for the majority of artifact removal algorithms. This reliance can hinder the model’s implementation in real-world applications. This paper proposes EEGANet, a framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to address this issue as a data-driven assistive tool for ocular artifacts removal (source code is available at https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/EEGANet). After the model was trained, the removal of ocular artifacts could be applied calibration-free without relying on the EOG channels or the eye blink detection algorithms. First, we tested EEGANet’s ability to generate multi-channel EEG signals, artifacts removal performance, and robustness using the EEG eye artifact dataset, which contains a significant degree of data fluctuation. According to the results, EEGANet is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches that utilize EOG channels for artifact removal. Moreover, we demonstrated the effectiveness of EEGANet in BCI applications utilizing two distinct datasets under inter-day and subject-independent schemes. Despite the absence of EOG signals, the classification performance of the signals processed by EEGANet is equivalent to that of traditional baseline methods. This study demonstrates the potential for further use of GANs as a data-driven artifact removal technique for any multivariate time-series bio-signal, which might be a valuable step towards building next-generation healthcare technology.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3131104","PTT Public Company Limited; SCB Public Company Limited; Thailand Science Research and Innovation(grant numbers:SRI62W1501); Ministry of Higher Education(grant numbers:RGNS63-252); National Research Council of Thailand(grant numbers:N41A640131); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627782","AI in healthcare;brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);generative adversarial networks (GANs);multivariate time-series data;ocular artifact removal","Electroencephalography;Electrooculography;Inspection;Brain modeling;Usability;Integrated circuits;Electrodes","Algorithms;Artifacts;Blinking;Electroencephalography;Electrooculography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","45","","40","IEEE","26 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper designs proposal of signal detection instead of classification, and which does not require such perplexing analysis procedures. This signal detection concept is carried out by establishing Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of resting brain activity (idle state), so that any imagined movement or real movement signals in brain can be detected. GMM as a versatile modeling tool can be used to approximate any probability density function (pdf) given a sufficient number of components, and impose only minimal assumptions about the modeled random variables. Meanwhile GMM is effective in the calculation. Our best results were 82% on BCI Competition 2002 - Data set and 75% on BCI Competition 2003 - Data set IV in accuracy rate. It confirms the truth of feasibility on detection.

We implemented two approximate second-order methods to optimize the weights of these networks, because the more common first-order methods are very slow to converge for networks like these with more than three layers of computational units. The resulting non-linear projections of time embedded EEG signals show interesting separations that are related to tasks.

Firstly, the raw EEG signal is preprocessed by band-pass filtering, and encoded into spike signals by Ben’s Spike encoding algorithm. Then, convolution layers and pooling layer is designed in SNN to take advantage of the characteristics of EEG signal. Finally, the SNN is employed to classify the spike signals. It is worth noting that the activation function in SNN is different from the convolutional neural network. It simulates biological encode information of brain in the form of spikes by the LIF model. By simulating the change process of membrane potential, it realizes the transmission of intercellular spikes and the active release of membrane potential without input, which makes the signal processing closer to the neuron cell membrane potential processing mechanism. On the other hand, since spike signals can weaken the negative effect of noise in the superposition process, spikes input can reduce the influence of noise in the network. The BCI Competition IV 2a datasets are used in the experiments, and the classification results show that the proposed classification method achieves the average classification accuracy of 82.08%.","","979-8-3503-0439-8","10.1109/ICNC-FSKD59587.2023.10281037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10281037","","Training;Neurons;Membrane potentials;Signal processing algorithms;Pattern classification;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","","","17","IEEE","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, we compare the accuracy of MI decoders that use BC features in source vs. sensor space. Applied to the BCI Competition VI Dataset 2a (left- vs. right-hand MI decoding), our study found that PLV in sensor space achieves the highest classification accuracy among BC features and has similar performance compared to single-channel features, while the transition from sensor to source space reduces the average accuracy of BC features.

In this study, we developed such a hybrid EEG/NIRS brain switch and compared its performance with single modality EEG- and NIRS-based brain switch respectively, in terms of true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), onset detection time (ODT), and information transfer rate (ITR). In an offline analysis, the performance of a hybrid EEG/NIRS brain switch was significantly improved over that of EEG- and NIRS-based brain switches in general, and in particular a significantly lower FPR was observed for the hybrid EEG/NIRS brain switch. A pseudo-online analysis was additionally performed to confirm the feasibility of implementing an online BCI system with our hybrid EEG/NIRS brain switch. The overall trend of pseudo-online analysis results generally coincided with that of the offline analysis results. No significant difference in all performance measures was also found between offline and pseudo online analysis schemes when the amount of training data was same, with one exception for the ITRs of an EEG brain switch.

A brain-computer interface system can be implemented using electroencephalogram signals because it poses more less clinical risk and can be acquired using portable instruments. One of the most interesting tasks for the brain-computer interface system is decoding words from the raw electroencephalogram signals. Before a brain-computer interface may be used by a new user, current electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface research typically necessitates a subject-specific adaption stage. In contrast, the subject-independent situation is one that is highly desired since it allows a well-trained model to be applied to new users with little or no precalibration. The emphasis is on creating an efficient decoder that may be employed adaptively in subject-independent circumstances in light of this crucial characteristic. Our proposal is to explicitly apply skip connections between convolutional layers to enable the flow of mutual information between layers. To do this, we add skip connections between layers, allowing the mutual information to flow throughout the layers. The output of the encoder is then passed through the fully-connected layer to finally represent the probabilities of the 13 classes. In this study, overt speech was used to record the electroencephalogram data of 16 participants. The results show that when the skip connection is present, the classification performance improves notably.","2572-7672","978-1-6654-6444-4","10.1109/BCI57258.2023.10078601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078601","brain–computer interface;deep learning;electroencephalography;speech processing","Performance evaluation;Convolution;Instruments;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Decoding;Reliability","","","","30","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a single-layer convolutional neural network is used to replace the preprocessing steps in previous work. Then, focal loss is used to overcome the imbalance in the dataset.

This procedure requires approximately 20-30 min to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder. It is, therefore, an interesting topic to build a calibration-free, or subject-independent, BCI. In this article, we construct a large motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) database and propose a subject-independent framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days, resulting in 21 600 trials for the MI task. In our framework, we formulated the discriminative feature representation as a combination of the spectral-spatial input embedding the diversity of the EEG signals, as well as a feature representation learned from the CNN through a fusion technique that integrates a variety of discriminative brain signal patterns. To generate spectral-spatial inputs, we first consider the discriminative frequency bands in an information-theoretic observation model that measures the power of the features in two classes. From discriminative frequency bands, spectral-spatial inputs that include the unique characteristics of brain signal patterns are generated and then transformed into a covariance matrix as the input to the CNN. In the process of feature representations, spectral-spatial inputs are individually trained through the CNN and then combined by a concatenation fusion technique. In this article, we demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our subject-independent (or calibration-free) model outperforms that of subject-dependent models using various methods [common spatial pattern (CSP), common spatiospectral pattern (CSSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and Bayesian spatio-spectral filter optimization (BSSFO)].","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2946869","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant; Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of Intelligent Pattern Recognition Softwares for Ambulatory Brain-Computer Interface) and (Development of BCI based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User‘s Intentions using Deep Learning)(grant numbers:2015-0-00185,2017-0-00451); Samsung Research Funding Center of Samsung Electronics(grant numbers:SRFC-TC1603-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897723","Brain–computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning (DL);electroencephalography (EEG);motor imagery (MI);subject-independent","Electroencephalography;Databases;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Calibration","Adult;Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Databases, Factual;Deep Learning;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Imagination;Information Theory;Male;Movement;Neural Networks, Computer;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult","264","","66","CCBY","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These artifacts must be corrected before further analysis because it renders subsequent analysis very error-prone. One solution is to reject the data segment if artifact is present during the observation interval, however, the rejected data segment could contain important information masked by the artifact. It has already been demonstrated that independent component analysis (ICA) can be an effective and applicable method for EEG de-noising. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework, based on ICA and wavelet denoising (WD), to improve the pre-processing of EEG signals. In particular we employ the concept of spatially-constrained ICA (SCICA) to extract artifact-only independent components (ICs) from the given EEG data, use WD to remove any brain activity from extracted artifacts, and finally project back the artifacts to be subtracted from EEG signals to get clean EEG data. The main advantage of the proposed approach is faster computation, as all ICs are not identified in the usual manner due to the square mixing assumption. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in removing focal artifacts that can be well separated by SCICA.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333725","","Electroencephalography;Independent component analysis;Noise reduction;Data mining;Muscles;Signal processing;Error analysis;Error correction;Brain modeling;Computational modeling","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software;Time Factors","8","","11","IEEE","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by our recent work on Upscale and Downscale Representation (UDR), this paper proposes a cascade arrangement of some effective image-processing techniques for signal filtering in the image domain. The UDR concept is to visualize EEG signals at an appropriate line width and convert it to a binary image. The smoothing process is then conducted by skeletonizing the signal object to a unit width and projecting it back to the time domain. Two successive UDRs could result in a better-smoothing performance, but their binary image conversion should be restricted. The process is computationally ineffective, especially at higher line width values. Cascaded Thinning UDR (CTUDR) is proposed, exploiting morphological operations to perform a two-stage upscale and downscale within one binary image representation. CTUDR is verified on a signal smoothing and classification task and compared with conventional techniques, such as the Moving Average, the Binomial, the Median, and the Savitzky Golay filters. Simulated EEG data with added white Gaussian noise is employed in the former, while cognitive conflict data obtained from a 3D object selection task is utilized in the latter. CTUDR outperforms its counterparts, scoring the best fitting error and correlation coefficient in signal smoothing while achieving the highest gain in Accuracy (0.7640%) and F-measure (0.7607%) when used as a smoothing filter for training data of EEGNet.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3465515","research project QG (QG.23.35) of Vietnam National University, Hanoi; Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:DP210101093,DP220100803); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(grant numbers:APP2021183); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10693637","Smoothing;thinning;skeletonization;electroen-cephalogram (EEG);signal processing;time-series;noise;filter","Filters;Electroencephalography;Smoothing methods;Signal processing;Noise;Time-domain analysis;Skeleton","Electroencephalography;Humans;Algorithms;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Normal Distribution;Computer Simulation;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","2","","34","CCBY","25 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the performance of a classification algorithm trained for an individual subject on a certain day deteriorates during the following days. The traditional approach is to recalibrate the algorithm every session, limiting the wide use of BCIs. Here, we use an autoencoder convolutional neural network to identify a low dimensional representation of the EEG signals from the first day (or days) and show that this allows for stable decoding performance on the following days without resorting to recalibration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the residual signals, namely the difference between the original and reconstructed EEG, can be used to accurately discriminate among different recording sessions. In line with that, the reconstructed EEG cannot be used to discriminate among recording sessions. This implies that the reconstructed EEG reflects an invariant representation of the subject's intent, whereas the residual signals reflect a non-stationary component, which differs from one session to another.

It is extensively used in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and can be used for disease diagnosis, disease treatment, etc. The two main technologies of EEG signal analysis is feature extraction and pattern recognition. The key features of EEG signals can be obtained through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The wavelet analysis is one kind of time-frequency analysis and has been considered very promising for data compression. The conventional method find wavelet synopsis to minimize the total mean squared error (L2). It cannot control the approximation error of each single data element in the data vector. Usually, the nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linears, also more time-consuming in the meantime. In this paper, one method is provided to realize the feature extraction and pattern recognition of EEG signals. The data compression algorithm Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) proposed by Pang et al. takes a novel method to construct unrestricted Haar wavelet synopsis under uniform norm (L∞) error bound. In their algorithm, the maximum approximation error of each individual element can be bounded by an given error bound. We apply this method to EEG signal compression, thus the key features are obtained. Then a fast nonlinear classification algorithm, one Randomize Neural Network (RNN), is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals. The experiments indicate that (1) the F-Shift algorithm can compress EEG signals effectively and obtain the key features at the same time and (2) the RNN can discriminate different patterns of EEG signals based on the extracted features.","2157-9563","978-1-4673-7679-2","10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378121","Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis;Signal compression;Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) algorithm;Randomize Neural Network (RNN)","Electroencephalography;Wavelet transforms;Biological neural networks;Approximation algorithms;Data compression;Signal processing algorithms;Diseases","","1","","16","IEEE","11 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we use multi-way (Tensor) analysis for localizing the EEG events. We used EMD process for decomposing EEG into distinct oscillatory modes, which are then mapped to TF plane using the near optimal Reassigned Spectrogram. Temporal, Spatial and Spectral information of the Multichannel EEG are then used to generate a three-way Frequency-Time-Space EEG tensor. Exploiting EMD also enables us to detrend the EEG recordings.

This paper discusses a lossless compression scheme for EEG signals that involves a predictor and an adaptive error modeling technique. The prediction residues are arranged based on the error count through an histogram computation. Two optimal regions are identified in the histogram plot through a heuristic search such that the bit requirement for encoding the two regions is minimum. Further improvement in the compression is achieved by removing the statistical redundancy that is present in the residue signal by using a context-based bias cancellation scheme. Three neural network predictors, namely, single-layer perceptron, multilayer perceptron, and Elman network and two linear predictors, namely, autoregressive model and finite impulse response filter are considered. Experiments are conducted using EEG signals recorded under different physiological conditions and the performances of the proposed methods are evaluated in terms of the compression ratio.

An EEG is generally measured from electrodes placed on the scalp. However, it is not suitable for daily use because the preparation time is relatively long, and the electrodes are likely to cause discomfort to the user. EEG measurements from disposable electrodes placed on the forehead (forehead EEG) have been used to mitigate this disadvantage. However, because many ERP components used in BCI show the maximal voltage on the scalp, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ERPs obtained from a forehead EEG is low, which may affect the reliability of a BCI system. To address this shortcoming, we propose convolutional neural networks that predict the EEG signal measured from electrodes placed on the scalp (scalp EEG) from forehead EEG. In the study, we focused on predicting the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, and single-trial scalp EEG at Fz was predicted from three forehead EEG measures (Fpz, horizontal, and vertical electrooculograms). Data were measured while nine subjects performed a passive auditory oddball task. To evaluate the proposed model, the mean squared error (MSE) between the observed single-trial EEG at Fz and the predicted single-trial EEG from three forehead EEG measures was calculated, as well as the MSE between the observed ERP difference wave (deviant – standard) at Fz and the difference wave predicted from three forehead EEG measures within the time window in which MMN was observed. The result showed that within the time window in which MMN was observed, the MSE between the ERP difference wave at Fz and the ERP difference wave predicted from three forehead EEG measures was significantly smaller than the MSE between the ERP difference wave at Fz and the ERP difference wave at the forehead (Fpz).

This technology can meet the control requirements of external equipment without passing through the patient's damaged nerves and declining muscle system. Electroencephalogram (EEG) contains a variety of information, including motor imagination information, steady-state visually evoked EEG information, emotional information, and fatigue information, etc. This paper designs a brain-computer interface system based on motor imagination and uses it to control the body movements of the NAO robot. The system is mainly divided into three modules: signal acquisition, signal processing and robot control. In terms of signal acquisition, electrode caps, conductive glue, EEG amplifiers and Curry7 software are used. In this paper, we design a frequency band feature selection algorithm based on an improved sub-band filter bank (FB)-Common Space Pattern (CSP). These features are classified using Bagging ensemble classification algorithm and converted to use Commands for controlling the NAO robot. In terms of communication control, the instruction codes are preset, and the classification results are corresponding to instructions for controlling different actions of the robot. It is transmitted to the robot by using wireless communication technology. The Bagging ensemble classification method proposed in this paper classifies EEG features. The accuracy of the four types of motor imaging EEG classification is as high as 78.29%, and the accuracy of NAO robot action execution experiments is up to 86.33%, which proves the correctness of the algorithm studied in this paper.

We are addressing a problem in developing an on-line adaptive algorithm for RCE. Since a rhythmic signal in the brain slowly varies, the signals extracted in adjacent frames should not largely different. We propose introducing a regularization term that evaluates the correlation between the signal extracted in the last step and the one to be extracted to achieve this.

This research proposes a superior novel approach that combines phase locking value (PLV) and covariance representations by feature-level fusion by using an autoencoder on brain-inspired reservoir-based spiking neural networks (BI-SNNs) to estimate drivers' reaction times by examining the EEG data. By fusing PLV and covariance features into the reservoir-based BI-SNN method, the network can efficiently capture the spatio-temporal dynamics in the data.

The authors' method uses ensembled electroencephalogram (EEG) data just as used in conventional averaging, however without the need for a priori data subgrouping into distinct categories (e.g., stimulus- or event-related), and thus avoids conventional assumptions on response invariability. The competitive ANN, often described as a winner takes all neural structure, is based on dynamic competition among the net neurons where learning takes place only with the winning neuron. Using a simple single-layered structure, the proposed scheme results in convergence of the actual neural weights to the embedded ERP patterns. The method is applied to real event-related potential data recorded during a common odd-ball type paradigm. For the first time, within-session variable signal patterns are automatically identified, dismissing the strong and limiting requirement of a priori stimulus-related selective grouping of the recorded data.

Specifically, we utilize a non-invasive 64-channel EEG cap to capture the brain activity of six subjects as they view 40 images across five object categories. Subsequently, we employ two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network structures to extract feature vectors from the EEG signals.

By making a statistical comparison between fMRI scans in which the EEG-phenomenon is present and in which it is absent, and detecting the voxels in which this difference is significant, one can localize the brain regions involved in the generation of the EEG phenomenon under study. Furthermore, one can determine whether the phenomenon corresponds to an activation or a de-activation of the brain region. In practice, however, there are many bio-signal processing problems to be solved: the artifact removal in the EEG, the demodulation of the EEG, the extraction of an EEG reference from the multi-channels, the determination of a sensible correlation co-efficient (in which heart beat effects and breathing are eliminated) and its statistical significance.

While the EEG signal processing methods in EEG based BCI are appealing, they face substantial practical problems. Due to the limitation of EEG signal recording technology, physiological artifacts, especially those generated by eye (EOG, electrooculography), interfere with EEG, may change the characteristics of the neurological phenomena in EEG, and make those signal processing performs incompetently. Linear combination and regression is the most common used technique for removing ocular artifacts from EEG signals where a fraction of the EOG signal is subtracted from the EEG. One problem is that subtracting the EOG signal may also remove part of the EEG signal, for the EOG signal to be subtracted is also contaminated with the EEG signal. In this paper, a new EOG correction model is introduced for EOG artifacts, where the EEG contained in the EOG is considered, and thus avoid removing part of the EEG signal by subtracting the EOG signal. In order to apply this new model in online BCI signal processing, this paper adopts the AR (autoregressive) filtering model of the EEG activity to detect the EOG artifacts, only if it exists, the EEG correction method are performed.

Traditional works classify EEG signals without considering the topological relationship among electrodes. However, neuroscience research has increasingly emphasized network patterns of brain dynamics. Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately reflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) is presented to enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types of motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological relationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson’s matrix of overall signals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes is built up. The GCNs-Net constructed by graph convolutional layers learns the generalized features. The followed pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and the fully-connected (FC) softmax layer derives the final prediction. The introduced approach has been shown to converge for both personalized and groupwise predictions. It has achieved the highest averaged accuracy, 93.06% and 88.57% (PhysioNet dataset), 96.24% and 80.89% (high gamma dataset), at the subject and group level, respectively, compared with existing studies, which suggests adaptability and robustness to individual variability. Moreover, the performance is stably reproducible among repetitive experiments for cross-validation. The excellent performance of our method has shown that it is an important step toward better BCI approaches. To conclude, the GCNs-Net filters EEG signals based on the functional topological relationship, which manages to decode relevant features for brain MI.

In recent studies, the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has contributed to substantial improvements in the EEG signal classification performance. However, there is still a key challenge with the existing CNN-based EEG signal classification methods, the accuracy of them is not very satisfying. This is because most of the existing methods only utilize the feature maps in the last layer of CNN for EEG signal classification, which might miss some local and detailed information for accurate classification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-scale CNN model-based EEG signal classification method. In this method, first, the EEG signals are preprocessed and converted to time-frequency images using the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) technique. Then, a multi-scale CNN model is designed for EEG signal classification, which takes the converted time-frequency image as the input. Especially, in the designed multi-scale CNN model, both the local and global information is taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the benchmark data set 2b used in the BCI contest IV. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 73.9 percent, which improves the classification accuracy of 10.4, 5.5, 16.2 percent compared with the traditional methods including artificial neural network, support vector machine, and stacked auto-encoder.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2020.3039834","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002304); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:22120190211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266581","Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification;human intention-behavior;short time fourier transform (STFT);multi-scale convolutional neural networks","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Time-frequency analysis;Pattern classification;Image segmentation","Algorithms;Brain;Electroencephalography;Humans;Intention;Neural Networks, Computer;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","26","","30","IEEE","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies using deep learning (DL) methods have reported good performance for offline artifact elimination. However, existing methods still neglect two key defects in clinical applications: (1) offline processing may not fit inreal-time BCI application scenarios; and (2) direct and arbitrary usage of conventional neural network structures lacks physiological interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid method for EEG artifact elimination, combining a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) module–a blind source separation method with a multi-scaled convolutional neural network (CNN) module. Specifically, the CCA module transfers the recorded EEG signals simultaneously from the channel space to the source space and the CNN module detects and eliminates artifacts with explainable processing.

At the same time, it shows a good application effect in the process of application practice. At present, the main EEG recognition and analysis algorithms always have some problems and defects in data processing, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, unclean noise filtering, and high data dimension. In this paper, based on the improved BP neural network algorithm, weight splitting technology is added to the traditional BP neural network algorithm. In order to solve the filtering problem, this paper uses the non-linear mapping function of the traditional BP neural network, and intelligently trains the small weight particles by combining the particle swarm filter algorithm, so as to improve the filtering performance of the whole BP algorithm. Based on the above two algorithms, the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unclean filtering in EEG data processing caused by fast weight degradation in traditional BP algorithm can be solved. Finally, according to the actual data of brain-computer interface, this paper compares the improved BP neural network algorithm with the traditional BP neural network algorithm in recognition and analysis of motor imagery EEG signals.

Historically, BCIs were developed with biomedical applications in mind, such as restoring communication in completely paralyzed individuals and replacing lost motor function. More recent applications have targeted nondisabled individuals by exploring the use of BCIs as a novel input device for entertainment and gaming. The task of the BCI is to identify and predict behaviorally induced changes or ""cognitive states"" in a user's brain signals.

This is achieved in two main steps. In the first step, we take EEG response to color stimuli from the scalp using the standard 10-20 electrode system. Experiments undertaken using Exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Topographic (eLORETA) software reveal that there exist long term (around 1 second) correlations between activated brain regions and the perceptual process of specific color stimulus. For instance, the parietal and the occipital lobe activations have long duration correlations with the blue color stimuli; whereas the prefrontal and the occipital lobe activations have correlations with the red color, while the temporal and the occipital lobe activations have correlations with the green color. In the second step, we classify the perceived color of the brain signals acquired from the selected brain regions. A one dimensional based Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) classifier has been designed to perform the classification process by utilizing the brain signals from the activated lobes. The present classifier model has also been compared with other primitive classifiers.

Firstly, the covariance matrix of the symmetric positive definite matrix is selected as the descriptor in the pre-processed raw EEG signal, and the EEG signal described in the spatio-temporal domain in Euclidean space is reasonably transformed to Riemannian space, then the infinite-dimensional symmetric positive definite matrix is obtained by kernel mapping, and the low-dimensional vector estimation of the infinite-dimensional symmetric positive definite matrix is used to obtain a low-dimensional efficient EEG signal feature set using a specific feature mapping, and finally a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is constructed according to the feature set Finally, a CNN classifier is constructed based on the feature set for classification.

Seizure detection is a major determinant of seizure management and therefore timely seizures detection is important in managing the problem. This work suggests the use of new NonLinear Vector Decomposed Neural Network analysis methods in the context of the classification of EEG signal to detect seizures. By decomposing a relatively complex structure of signals that are recorded from the scalp through the use of the NVDN framework, the model is able to better decode the constellations of features that may be indicative of seizure activity. To that end, we used an extensive data of EEG signals which was preprocessed by cleaning up noise and artifacts before performing feature extraction based on time frequency analysis.

Patients with motor disorders may benefit from BCIs as a means of communication and for the restoration of motor functions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of most used for evaluating the neuronal activity. In many computer vision applications, deep neural networks (DNN) show significant advantages. Towards to ultimate usage of DNN, we present here a shallow neural network that uses mainly two convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, with relatively few parameters and fast to learn spectral-temporal features from EEG. We compared this models to three other neural network models with different depths applied to a mental arithmetic task using eye-closed state adapted for patients suffering from motor disorders and a decline in visual functions. Experimental results showed that the shallow CNN model outperformed all the other models and achieved the highest classification accuracy of 90.68%.

Recent studies on brain-to-speech using non-invasive brain signals have mostly proved the possibility of decoding words or sentences with repeated and predefined classes. In order to facilitate intuitive and natural communication via brain signals, decoding unconstrained speech in the same way as natural human communication is essential. In this study, we demonstrated the potential of speech synthesis for unseen sentences from biosignals by training the generative model to learn phonological features. We focused on constructing a sequence-conscious architecture that learns temporal dependencies and also leveraging the phoneme prediction loss term to extract speech-related features. Therefore, the feasibility of sentence-level neural communication based on non-predefined vocabularies was addressed, particularly training with non-repetitive sentences. Additionally, we conducted neurophysiological and spatio-spectral analysis by comparing brain activity during speech in terms of cortical and functional brain regions. Our results display the potential of unconstrained sentence generation, which may ultimately provide a new form of human interaction mediated by brain signals.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782977","brain-computer interface;brain-to-speech;deep neural networks;electroencephalogram;electromyogram;speech synthesis","Training;Vocabulary;Neural activity;Linguistics;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Speech synthesis;Engineering in medicine and biology","Humans;Speech;Brain;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Algorithms","","","22","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methods are particularly fruitful when they are strongly correlated with intuitive physical concepts that allow a better understanding of brain dynamics [1]. Here, new method based on wavelet entropy (WE) and Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) is applied. The WE carries information about the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal. In addition, the time evolution of the WE is calculated to give information about the dynamics in the EEG records. Within this framework, the major objective of the present work was to characterize in a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in short duration EEG signals. This paper has tried to use fuzzy neural networks (FNN) as a classification method, which combines fuzzy membership and neural network frame, to drive the model automatically update in training and leaning processes, thus it can be applied in the simulations of complex conditions. In this way, EEG signals under motor imagery conditions were analyzed.","","978-0-9567157-1-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6260280","BCI;wavelet entropy (WE);Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN);motor imagery EEG","Fuzzy neural networks;Entropy;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","","","","22","","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even in case of non-stationary and subject specific MI-EEG signals, DL methods offer high accuracy in classifying MI tasks. In this paper, a dual band convolutional neural network (DBCNN) based on MI-EEG two band limited efficient signals is proposed. Here, beta wave signals are used to improve classification performance in motor imagery tasks. Beta waves are associated with motor imagery tasks. On the other hand our second signal is the pre-processed bandpass signal. The DBCNN model uses temporal CNN and spatial CNN to explore temporal and spatial features. This model also uses a spatial convolutional network for single channels from multiple channels. Finally the data are classified for MI-EEG signal classification accuracy. An extensive experiment on MI-based BCI IV 2a EEG dataset on nine subjects shows that very satisfactory classification performance is achieved.

To evaluate the performance of our proposed MESNP model, we conducted single-subject and multisubject four-class classification experiments on two public datasets, MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP. Compared with existing feature extraction methods, the MESNP model significantly enhances the multiclass emotional classification performance in the single-subject and multisubject conditions. To evaluate the online version of the proposed MESNP model, we designed an online emotion monitoring system. We recruited 14 participants to conduct the online emotion decoding experiments. The average online experimental accuracy of the 14 participants was 84.56%, indicating that our model can be applied in affective brain–computer interface (aBCI) systems. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MESNP model effectively captures discriminative graph topology patterns and significantly improves emotion classification performance.

Existing graph networks for EEG classification are based on homogeneous graphs, yet the nature of the cerebral cortex aligns more closely with a heterogeneous graph structure. To this end, we propose HeteroEEG for EEG classification, which to the best of our knowledge is the first to reframe the challenge of exploring EEG spatial information, especially decoupling different types of brain lobes and functional connections, as heterogeneous graph reasoning. Specifically, HeteroEEG is designed to be a dual-branch network aware of spatial, spectral, and temporal EEG features.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has several attractive features. 1) The size of inert region is becoming more large and more the RMS values low. 2) The following the distance is closer, the RMS values is low. That could be considered inert region exists near by the electrode which has low RMS potential. 3) The more larger inert region were, the more small estimation error become.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4353237","neural network;electroencephalography;localization of inert region;modified Levenberg Marquardt","Biological neural networks;Electroencephalography;Multiple signal classification;Independent component analysis;Brain modeling;Inverse problems;Principal component analysis;Biomedical engineering;Electrodes;Signal processing","Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Humans;Models, Biological;Nerve Net","","","23","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some BCIs usually use one variable, while other variables are fixed. However, it is also necessary to integrate the two variables. This research used emotional variables and motor imagery without a cross-correlation factor. EEG signals as intermediate are extracted into the wave that is represented motor imagery and emotion using Wavelet transformation. Wavelet provided the Alpha, Mu, Beta, and Theta waves. We added an amplitude feature beside four waves. Then, the features are classified by Convolutional Neural Networks. The experiment was carried out using three optimization models, i.e., Adam, AdaDelta, and AdaMax, which gave the best accuracy of 90% with AdaMax and VGG16.

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI is one of the promising solutions due to its convenient and portable instruments. Despite the extensive research of EEG in recent years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to its nature of noise and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relations between EEG signals and specific brain activities. Most existing works either only consider EEG as chain-like sequences while neglecting complex dependencies between adjacent signals or requiring complex preprocessing. In this paper, we introduce two deep learning-based frameworks with novel spatio-temporal preserving representations of raw EEG streams to precisely identify human intentions. The two frameworks consist of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks effectively exploring the preserved spatial and temporal information in either a cascade or a parallel manner. Extensive experiments on a large scale movement intention EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3 145 160 EEG records) have demonstrated that the proposed frameworks achieve high accuracy of 98.3% and outperform a set of state-of-the-art and baseline models. The developed models are further evaluated with a real-world brain typing BCI and achieve a recognition accuracy of 93% over five instruction intentions suggesting good generalization over different kinds of intentions and BCI systems.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2905157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698218","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);intention recognition;spatial information;temporal information","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Biological neural networks;Recurrent neural networks","Algorithms;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Deep Learning;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Intention;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Spatio-Temporal Analysis","282","","53","IEEE","24 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For EEG-based emotion recognition systems, it is crucial to utilize state-of-the-art learning strategies to automatically learn emotion-related brain cognitive patterns from emotional EEG signals, and the learned stable cognitive patterns effectively ensure the robustness of the emotion recognition system. In this work, to realize the efficient decoding of emotional EEG, we propose a graph learning system [Graph Convolutional Network framework with Brain network initial inspiration and Fused attention mechanism (BF-GCN)] inspired by the brain cognitive mechanism to automatically learn graph patterns from emotional EEG and improve the performance of EEG emotion recognition. In the proposed BF-GCN, three graph branches, i.e., cognition-inspired functional graph branch, data-driven graph branch, and fused common graph branch, are first elaborately designed to automatically learn emotional cognitive graph patterns from emotional EEG signals. And then, the attention mechanism is adopted to further capture the brain activation graph patterns that are related to emotion cognition to achieve an efficient representation of emotional EEG signals. Essentially, the proposed BF-CGN model is a cognition-inspired graph learning neural network model, which utilizes the spectral graph filtering theory in the automatic learning and extracting of emotional EEG graph patterns. To evaluate the performance of the BF-GCN graph learning system, we conducted subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments on two public datasets, i.e., SEED and SEED-IV. The proposed BF-GCN graph learning system has achieved 97.44% (SEED) and 89.55% (SEED-IV) in subject-dependent experiments, and the results in subject-independent experiments have achieved 92.72% (SEED) and 82.03% (SEED-IV), respectively.

However, the existing methods cannot consider plural brain activities described with different frequency bands and different spatial patterns such as activities of mu and beta rhythms. In order to efficiently extract these brain activities, we propose a method to design plural filters and spatial weights which extract desired brain activity. The proposed method designs finite impulse response (FIR) filters and the associated spatial weights by optimization of an objective function which is a natural extension of CSP. Moreover, we show by a classification experiment that the bank of FIR filters which are designed by introducing an orthogonality into the objective function can extract good discriminative features.

However, training a universally effective model for everyone is impractical due to substantial interindividual variability in EEG signals. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end brain-computer interface (BCI) framework, including temporal and spatial one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network and domain-adversarial training strategy, namely DA-TSnet. Method: Specifically, DA-TSnet extracts temporal and spatial features of EEG, while it is jointly supervised by task loss and domain loss. During training, DA-TSnet aims to maximize the domain loss while simultaneously minimizing the task loss. We conduct an offline analysis, simulate online experiments on a self-collected dataset of 85 subjects, and real online experiments on 22 subjects. Main results: DA-TSnet achieves a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) classification accuracy of 89.40% $\pm$ 9.96%, outperforming several state-of-the-art attention EEG decoding methods. In simulated online experiments, DA-TSnet achieves an outstanding accuracy of 88.07% $\pm$ 11.22%. In real online experiments, it achieves an average accuracy surpassing 86%. Significance: An end-to-end network framework does not rely on elaborate preprocessing and feature extraction steps, which saves time and human workload. Moreover, our framework utilizes domain-adversarial training neural network (DANN) to tackle the challenge posed by the high interindividual variability in EEG signals, which has significant reference value for handling other EEG signal decoding issues.

This study has been conducted utilizing a public emotional EEG dataset called SEED. Before performing classification from the EEG signals, features have been extracted to acquire information. DWT has been introduced to disintegrate the preprocessed EEG signals into five separate frequency sub-bands (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta), and the statistical features of these DWT coefficients have been computed in the frequency domain. We applied three different wavelet functions to extract multiple features from the preprocessed signals and considered three statistical ones to distinguish relevant information about EEG signals. The wavelet functions are “coif5”, “db4”, and “db8”, and the statistical features are entropy, power, and standard deviation. In this experiment, the efficiency of emotion identification has been investigated for a set of 62 EEG channels. A non-linear SVM classifier has been trained using the features to categorize the signals into three mental states: negative, neutral and positive by applying 5-fold cross-validation.

Compared to the CNN or RNN based models, Transformer can better capture the temporal information in EEG signals and focus more on global features of the brain's functional activities. Importantly, according to the multiscale nature of EEG signals, it is crucial to consider the multi-band concept into the design of EEG Transformer architecture. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-band EEG Transformer (MEET) to represent and analyze the multiscale temporal time series of human brain EEG signals. MEET mainly includes three parts: 1) transform the EEG signals into multi-band images, and preserve the 3D spatial information between electrodes; 2) design a Band Attention Block to compute the attention maps of the stacked multi-band images and infer the fused feature maps; 3) apply the Temporal Self-Attention and Spatial Self-Attention modules to extract the spatiotemporal features for the characterization and differentiation of multi-frame dynamic brain states. Results: The experimental results show that: 1) MEET outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple open EEG datasets (SEED, SEED-IV, WM) for brain states classification; 2) MEET demonstrates that 5-bands fusion is the best integration strategy; and 3) MEET identifies interpretable brain attention regions. Significance: MEET is an interpretable and universal model based on the multiband-multiscale characteristics of EEG.

While machine learning shows promising results in classifying long multivariate time series, optimal prediction models and feature extraction methods for EEG classification remain elusive. Our study addressed the problem of EEG classification under the framework of brain age prediction, applying a deep learning model on EEG time series. We hypothesized that decomposing EEG signals into oscillatory modes would yield more accurate age predictions than using raw or canonically frequency-filtered EEG. Specifically, we employed multivariate intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs), an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) variant based on multivariate iterative filtering (MIF), with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Testing a large dataset of routine clinical EEG scans (n = 6540) from patients aged 1 to 103 years, we found that an ad-hoc CNN model without fine-tuning could reasonably predict brain age from EEGs. Crucially, MIMF decomposition significantly improved performance compared to canonical brain rhythms (from delta to lower gamma oscillations). Our approach achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.76 ± 0.33 and a correlation coefficient of 0.64 ± 0.01 in brain age prediction over the entire lifespan. Our findings indicate that CNN models applied to EEGs, preserving their original temporal structure, remains a promising framework for EEG classification, wherein the adaptive signal decompositions such as the MIF can enhance CNN models’ performance in this task.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3403198","Digital Research Alliance of Canada (alliancecan.ca); Digital Health and Geospatial Analytics Program at the National Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:DHGA-116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10535301","Convolutional neural network;EEG;multivariate iterative filtering;brain-age;MIMF","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Predictive models;Convolutional neural networks;Recording;Time-frequency analysis","Humans;Electroencephalography;Neural Networks, Computer;Young Adult;Adult;Child;Aged;Adolescent;Infant;Child, Preschool;Middle Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Male;Female;Brain;Algorithms;Deep Learning;Multivariate Analysis;Machine Learning;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","3","","36","CCBY","20 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To show the waveform of FDs, we use a windowing-based method or called time-dependent fractal dimension (TDFD) and the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence. Two feature parameters; K-L divergence and different expected values are proposed to be input variables of the classifier. Finally, featured data are classified by a three-layer feed-forward neural network based on a simple backpropagation algorithm. Experimental results can be considerably applied in a brain-computer interface (BCI) application and show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional method by improving average classification rates of 87.5% and 88.3% for left- and right-hand movement imagery tasks, respectively.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4650057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650057","","Electroencephalography;Fractals;Training;Imaging;Feature extraction;Artificial neural networks;Electrodes","Adult;Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Fractals;Humans;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","14","","13","IEEE","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the years many approaches have been explored in terms of neurological information, feature extraction, signal processing, and intention prediction. Two novel aspects are becoming increasingly interesting for the BCI community, i.e. BC modeling and ML techniques. The former aims at describing the interactions among different brain regions as connectivity patterns that reflect the dynamics of information flow at rest or when performing a task. The latter is becoming pervasive for its capability of modeling and predicting complex scenarios where a huge amount of data is involved. These aspects are relevant when considered by themselves, but become crucial assets when combined together. In this scenario, our research idea consists in identifying how the information in the two domains can be merged in a whole entity under a theoretical point of view: BC and ML applied to Electroencephalography (EEG) signals could provide the generalization capability, high accuracy and minimal computational time that allow researchers to build a reliable BCI capable to operate online.","1948-3554","978-1-7281-4337-8","10.1109/NER49283.2021.9441440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441440","","Machine learning;Signal processing;Reliability theory;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","","","19","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A dataset of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was constructed from 100 individuals by conducting a P300 speller task with a wearable EEG amplifier. A framework is proposed that initially improves cross- subject consistency of EEG features through a common feature extractor. Subsequently, a simple and compact convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is employed to learn an embedding sub-space, where the mapped EEG features are maximally separated, while pursuing the minimum distance within the same class and the maximum distance between different classes. Finally, the model’s generalization capability was further optimized through fine-tuning. Results: The proposed method significantly boosts the average accuracy of wearable P300 BCI to  $73.23\pm 7.62$ % without calibration and  $78.75\pm 6.37$ % with fine-tuning.

This paper proposes to use narrow period pulse for poisoning attack of EEG-based BCIs, which makes adversarial attacks much easier to implement. One can create dangerous backdoors in the machine learning model by injecting poisoning samples into the training set. Test samples with the backdoor key will then be classified into the target class specified by the attacker.

This research examines the use of three recurrent neural-network architectures to detect seizure-activity onset in multi-channel subdural EEG data. The neural networks' output represents the degree of seizure-like activity for each of the 94 channels and four closest neighboring electrodes. A decrease in the standard-deviation of the neural network output at each seizure-like event was noted. Also, by spectrogram analysis, a large increase in the low-frequency components of the variation at the time of the seizure event in each sample was seen. This suggests that, at the onset of seizure-like activity: 1) the magnitude of the signal standard-deviation across the subdural space is small; 2) the time-dependent change of the standard-deviation is small; 3) the signal power is concentrated in a small range of low-frequency components.

However, building subject-independent BCIs remains difficult because electroencephalography (EEG) is highly noisy and varies by subject.

Traditional machine learning techniques, relying on hand-crafted features from fixed analysis windows, can lead to the loss of discriminative information. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for robust automated feature learning from raw physiological signals. However, standard CNN architectures require two-dimensional image data as input. This has motivated research into innovative signal-to-image (STI) transformation techniques to convert one-dimensional time series into images preserving spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. This paper reviews recent advances in strategies for physiological signal-to-image conversion and their applications using CNNs for automated processing tasks. A systematic analysis of EEG, EMG, and ECG signal transformation and CNN-based analysis techniques spanning diverse applications, including brain-computer interfaces, seizure detection, motor control, sleep stage classification, arrhythmia detection, and more, are presented. Key insights are synthesized regarding the relative merits of different transformation approaches, CNN model architectures, training procedures, and benchmark performance. Current challenges and promising research directions at the intersection of deep learning and physiological signal processing are discussed.

First, using connectivity patterns between brain regions during MI task, six more frequent network features were selected and their maps were generated in 2D format; then a simple yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer was deployed for binary classification of MI tasks (left-hand, right-hand, both feet and tongue movements). The discrimination ability of these features was compared with each other.

The feasibility of such a system was tested by implementing its benchtop analogue, centered around a commercial, ultra-low power (ULP) digital signal processor (DSP, TMS320C5517, Texas Instruments). A suite of signal processing and BCI algorithms, including (de)multiplexing, Fast Fourier Transform, power spectral density, principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, Bayes rule, and finite state machine was implemented and tested in the DSP. The system's signal acquisition fidelity was tested and characterized by acquiring harmonic signals from a function generator. In addition, the BCI decoding performance was tested, first with signals from a function generator, and subsequently using human electroencephalogram (EEG) during eyes opening and closing task. On average, the system spent 322 ms to process and analyze 2 s of data. Crosstalk (<;-65 dB) and harmonic distortion (~1%) were minimal. Timing jitter averaged 49 μs per 1000 ms. The online BCI decoding accuracies were 100% for both function generator and EEG data. These results show that a complex BCI algorithm can be executed on an ULP DSP without compromising performance.

However, they did not optimize temporal information or may have been susceptible to overfitting when training data are limited and the feature space is of high dimension. Furthermore, most of these studies manually select data windows and low-pass frequencies. We propose an adaptive spatio-temporal (AST) filtering method to model MRPs more accurately in lower dimensional space. AST automatically optimizes all parameters by employing a Gaussian kernel to construct a low-pass time-frequency filter and a linear ridge regression (LRR) algorithm to compute a spatial filter. Optimal parameters are simultaneously sought by minimizing leave-one-out cross-validation error through gradient descent. Using four BCI datasets from 12 individuals, we compare the performances of AST filter to two popular methods: the discriminant spatial pattern filter and regularized spatio-temporal filter.

The human mind and mental processes are inherently quantum in nature. It is therefore logical to investigate the possibility of designing new approaches to Brain-computer interface (BCI) with the amalgamation of quantum and classical approaches. This paper presents an intelligent information processing paradigm to enhance the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) model using a non linear Schrodinger Wave Equation (SWE) is proposed here to filter the Motor Imagery (MI) based EEG signal of the BCI user. It is shown that if the potential field of the SWE is excited by the raw EEG data using a self-organized learning scheme, then the probability density function (pdf) associated with the EEG signal is transferred to the probability amplitude function which is the response of the SWE. In this scheme, the EEG data is encoded in terms of a particle like wave packet which helps to recover the EEG signal by denoising the raw data. Thus the filtered EEG signal is a wave packet which glides along and moves like a particle. This denoised EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. It is shown that the accuracy of the classifier output over the training and the evaluation datasets using the filtered EEG is enhanced compared to that using the raw EEG signal for six of the nine subjects with a fixed set of parameters for all the subjects.","","978-1-84919-469-3","10.1049/ic.2011.0028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183140","Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN);Brain-Computer Interface (BCI);Filter","","","3","","","","16 Apr 2012","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2920748","Center For Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS⁲B) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-009-150); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730362","Brain computer interface;motor imagery;steady-state visual evoked potential;electroencephalography;channel reduction;common frequency pattern","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Visualization;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Electrodes;Brain","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Female;Fourier Analysis;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Imagination;Male;Psychomotor Performance;Recognition, Psychology;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","22","","47","IEEE","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such long calibration times are due to the large between-user variability and thus to the need to collect numerous training electroencephalography (EEG) trials for the machine learning algorithms used in BCI design. In this paper, we first survey existing approaches to reduce or suppress calibration time, these approaches being notably based on regularization, user-to-user transfer, semi-supervised learning and a priori physiological information. We then propose new tools to reduce BCI calibration time. In particular, we propose to generate artificial EEG trials from the few EEG trials initially available, in order to augment the training set size. These artificial EEG trials are obtained by relevant combinations and distortions of the original trials available. We propose three different methods to do so. We also propose a new, fast and simple approach to perform user-to-user transfer for BCI. Finally, we study and compare offline different approaches, both old and new ones, on the data of 50 users from three different BCI data sets.

EEG studies have found a peak latency of the speech-FFR at around 10 ms with putative subcortical origin while recent MEG studies identified additional cortical contributions to the speech-FFR driven by the carrier and the envelope modulations at higher frequencies. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the speech-FFR at the fundamental frequency using linear modelling and inverse source localization. We found that the response mainly originates from subcortical sources with major contributions from the midbrain for the two implemented acoustic features, the fundamental waveform and higher frequency envelope modulations. Interestingly, the latter evoked some additional brainstem activity at latencies significantly later than the typical subcortical latency range.

Therefore, we propose an alternative approach based on an eigenstructure decomposition of the signals' time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models. The eigen-based decomposition of the TVAR representation allows for subject-specific estimation of the principal time-varying frequencies, then such principal eigencomponents can be used in the traditional CSP-based classification.

As the computer technology advances in the last several decades, brain computer interface (BCI) is now an important area for brain research and practice. Neurological phenomena that are special features of brain activity appearing the brain signals is the source for controlling BCI systems. Various methods have been used to capture the brain signals and analyze the neurological phenomena. One of the method is Electroencephalography (EEG) that is the recording of electrical activities along the surface of scalp. The EEG signals are usually contaminated with artifacts due to noise and biological reasons such as eye movements. These artifacts need to be detected and removed so that the signal data are clean for further analysis. In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting closed and open eyes from EEG signals. There are a lot of eye blink detection research in the literature but most of those studies used EEG devices with multiple channels. Using a multi-channel EEG device helps increasing the accuracy but some operations such as feature selection or mounting the EEG device into the subject's head, become more complex and time consuming. In this study, we focus on analyzing ocular activity using an EEG device with only one channel.","","978-0-7695-5071-8","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2013.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630367","EEG;brain computer interface;eye activity detection;feature selection;pattern extraction","Electroencephalography;Indexes;Brain-computer interfaces;Brain;Smoothing methods;Analysis of variance;Headphones","","5","","16","IEEE","15 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For decorrelating EEG signals, we use the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) which is known to have good decorrelating properties and to show a good match to the standard clinical bands in EEG.

This study can help disabled people to increase their independence and quality of life. Electrical impulses from the human scalp are detected and converted into control commands that may be utilized to control external equipment, computer screens, and virtual objects in real time. The present work uses the Deep Learning method to interpret motor imagery signals for Brain-Computer Interface applications. ERD patterns are also gathered that represent the activation and deactivation of the motor cortex. In addition, task-related band power changes are recorded in every trial, which can show stimulation of sensory-motor areas. Furthermore, the goal is to categorize EEG data derived from a Motor Imagery task into two classes, viz. left and right, using the convolutional neural networks. The time-frequency pictures of EEG data fed as input to the convolutional neural network were obtained using continuous wavelet transform. The three channels were separated using data segmentation to convert the raw data into images. To get over the issue of few trials in motor imagery tasks, transfer learning strategies are employed. Transfer learning is applied to three premade neural networks GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet50, to proceed with CNN classification.

This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses approximate entropy (ApEn) as the input feature. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the predictability of the current amplitude values of a physiological signal based on its previous amplitude values. It is known that the value of the ApEn drops sharply during an epileptic seizure and this fact is used in the proposed system. Two different types of neural networks, namely, Elman and probabilistic neural networks, are considered in this paper.

Signal pre-processing is the most significant phase for EEG based applications, for instance, the brain computer interface (BCI) systems. This is because the quality of data acquired from the brain through EEG measurements is dependent on the effectiveness of artifact detection and removal methods. During EEG recording there are several factors that influence the quality of data. One of the factors of signal contamination occurs as the result of physiological and non-physiological artifacts.

The same textual content, when pronounced with different prosodies and emotions, may express totally different intentions. The true intentions in this condition can be easily grasped by our brain. Therefore, combining text, speech, and electroencephalography (EEG) for intent discrimination on the same text may be an effective approach. Before fusing speech and text modalities, the current study focused on exploring effective EEG-based features for Chinese intent recognition as no previous research has utilized EEG signals for this purpose. To tackle this issue, we first created a Chinese multimodal spoken language intention understanding (CMSLIU) dataset, in which the same texts were pronounced with varying prosodies to express different intents. To identify effective brain features that were most relevant to intent recognition improvement, we compared the event-related spectral perturbation and effective brain connectivity patterns on two intent conditions (praise vs. irony). It was found that the praise expression tended to elicit stronger high-frequency brain activities while the irony expression involved a more suppressive network connection in the right hemisphere. These features were trained on the CMSLIU dataset and achieved an intention classification accuracy of 78.66%, which indicated a great potential of the EEG features in intent discrimination on the same text.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-6327-7","10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10095376","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10095376","Intent understanding;paralinguistic information;brain network features;Human-computer interaction;EEG","Brain;Text recognition;Perturbation methods;Speech recognition;Oral communication;Signal processing;Linguistics","","1","","21","IEEE","5 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a popular spatial filtering method used to reduce the effect of volume conduction on EEG signals. It is thought that CSP requires a large number of electrodes to be effective. Using a 20-session dataset of motor imagery BCI usage by 5 stroke patients, we demonstrated that after channel selection, CSP can still maintain a high accuracy with low number of electrodes using a newly proposed channel selection method called CSP-rank (higher than 90% with 8 electrodes). The results showed that using only the first session for channel selection, a high accuracy can be maintained in subsequent sessions. CSP-rank has been compared to the popular support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The results showed that the CSP-rank required less electrodes to maintain accuracy higher than 90% (a minimum of 8 compared to 12 of SVM-RFE) and it attained a higher maximum accuracy (91.7% compared with 90.7% of SVM-RFE). This could support clinicians to apply more BCI in routine rehabilitation.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091566","","Electrodes;Accuracy;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Brain computer interfaces;Training;Spatial filters","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Self-Help Devices;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stroke;User-Computer Interface","17","","20","IEEE","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most current GCNN models adopt the spatial position between EEG channels to define the adjacency matrix, which have ignored the effective connection characteristics among the EEG signals. Granger causality (GC) analysis can reveal the causal connectivity between EEG channels. In this paper, an improved GCNN method based on the GC analysis is proposed for EEG emotion recognition. Firstly, the causal association matrix is calculated by the GC analysis. Then, a reasonable threshold is used to adaptively converts the causal association matrix into the adjacency matrix, which makes the adjacency matrix more consistent with the cognitive law of the human brain. Finally, the DEAP emotion dataset is used to test the performance of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GC-GCNN method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art methods, in which the average accuracies of 90.11%, 89.48% and 86.35% are respectively obtained for arousal, valence, and arousal-valence classifications.","","978-1-6654-6803-9","10.1109/ICCEAI55464.2022.00146","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371193); Shanxi Scholarship Council of China(grant numbers:HGKY2019025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853467","EEG emotion recognition;granger causality;graph convolutional neural networks;adjacency matrix","Emotion recognition;Convolution;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks","","2","","13","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One key challenge in current BCI research is how to extract features of random time-varying EEG signals and its classification as accurately as possible. Feature extraction techniques are used to extract the features which represent a unique property obtained from pattern of brain signal. Earlier EEG analysis was restricted to visual inspection only. The visual inspection of the signal is very subjective and hardly allows any standardization or statistical analysis. Hence, several different techniques were intended in order to quantify the information of the brain signal. Many linear and non-linear methods for feature extraction exist.

To this aim, monitoring the electrical activity of brain through Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as the prime choice for BCI systems. To discover the underlying and specific features of brain signals for different mental tasks, a considerable number of research works are developed based on statistical and data-driven techniques. However, a major bottleneck in development of practical and commercial BCI systems is their limited performance when the number of mental tasks for classification is increased. In this work, we propose a new EEG processing and feature extraction paradigm based on Siamese neural networks, which can be conveniently merged and scaled up for multi-class problems. The idea of Siamese networks is to train a double-input neural network based on a contrastive loss-function, which provides the capability of verifying if two input EEG trials are from the same class or not. In this work, a Siamese architecture, which is developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provides a binary output on the similarity of two inputs, is combined with One vs. Rest (OVR) and One vs. One (OVO) techniques to scale up for multi-class problems.

Next, a self-constructing graph neural network with a spatio-temporal model is presented. Specifically, the graph structure of the neural network is dynamically updated by the self-constructing module of the input signal. Experiments based on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets showed that the model achieved average accuracies of 85.90% and 76.37%, respectively.

In clinical besides, patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) suffer severe brain injuries, and sufficient training data for EEG-based emotion recognition cannot be collected. Our proposed ST-SCGNN method for cross-subject emotion recognition was first attempted in training in ten healthy subjects and testing in eight patients with DOC. We found that two patients obtained accuracies significantly higher than chance level and showed similar neural patterns with healthy subjects.

Unlike vector-based methods that destroy data structure, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) aims to process physiological signals in the form of multiway array, which considers relationships between dimensions and preserves structure information contained by the physiological signal. Nowadays, CPD is utilized as an unsupervised method for feature extraction in a classification problem. After that, a classifier, such as support vector machine, is required to classify those features. In this manner, classification task is achieved in two isolated steps. We proposed supervised CPD by directly incorporating auxiliary label information during decomposition, by which a classification task can be achieved without an extra step of classifier training. The proposed method merges the decomposition and classifier learning together, so it reduces procedure of classification task compared with that of respective decomposition and classification. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, three different kinds of signals, synthetic signal, EEG signal, and MEG signal, were used.

They had to correct the deviation and their response time was considered as an indicator of attention level. Participants repeated the task in two sessions; in one session they received kinesthetic feedback and in another session no feedback. Using their EEG signals, we trained three attention classifiers; a support vector machine (SVM) using EEG spectral band powers, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using either spectral features or the raw EEG data. Our results indicated that the CNN model trained on raw EEG data obtained under kinesthetic feedback achieved the highest accuracy (89%).

The paper exploits the underlying structure of EEG signals and presents an efficient method for reconstructing EEG signals based on local graph signal smoothness (LGS-based). Firstly, we introduce the concept of local graph signal smoothness according to distinct functional areas of the cerebral cortex. Then, considering the graph that does not properly represent similar relationships between signals will have a negative impact on the reconstruction performance, we propose a joint graph learning and EEG signal reconstruction optimization method. Since it is not jointly convex, we utilize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. In experiments, it is shown that the proposed LGS-based method outperforms benchmark methods in EEG signal reconstruction.

Automatic speech recognition gains huge improvements in recent years. Deep neural networks used in speech recognition chain improved speech recognition accuracy to very high levels. Also these days, end-to-end speech recognizers are getting better. In contrast with these recent improvements, end-user automatic speech recognition acceptance is quite low. It is due to the fact that it does not work very well on long distances from a microphone, yet. It is also impossible to use speech recognizers in places such as open offices or public places due to background noise. Another problem is that people do not want to disclose private or confidential information on loud. Electroencephalography based imagine speech recognizers could solve this acceptance rate.

Hence, the observed brain dynamics are influenced both by the topology of the sensor array and the underlying functional connectivity. Neural engineers are currently exploiting the advances in the domain of graph signal processing in an attempt to create robust and reliable brain decoding systems. In this direction, Geometric Deep Learning is a highly promising concept for combining the benefits of graph signal processing and deep learning towards revolutionising Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, its exploitation has been hindered by its data-demanding character. As a remedy, we propose here a novel data augmentation approach that combines the multiplex network modelling of multichannel signal with a graph variant of the classical Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and which proves to be a strong asset when combined with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs). As our graph-EMD algorithm makes no assumptions with respect to linearity and stationarity, it appears as an appealing solution towards analysing brain signals without artificially imposing regularities in either temporal or spatial domain. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme for data augmentation leads to substantial improvement when it is combined with GCNNs. Using recordings from two distinct BCI applications and comparing against a state-of-the-art augmentation method, we illustrate the benefits from its use. By making it available to BCI community, we hope to further foster the application of geometric deep learning in the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021580","Project MAMEM funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:644780); Project Evision that has been Co-Financed by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union and Greek National Funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH–CREATE–INNOVATE(grant numbers:T1EDK-02454); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186097","Brain-computer interfaces;BCI;data augmentation;EEG;geometric deep learning;graph CNN;GCNN;graph signal processing;neural engineering","Electroencephalography;Machine learning;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Laplace equations;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding","","21","","38","CCBY","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As end-to-end data-driven learning methods advance, the challenge lies in balancing model complexity with the need for human interpretability and trust. Despite strides in EEG-based BCIs, challenges like artefacts and low signal-to-noise ratio emphasise the ongoing importance of model transparency. This work proposes using post-hoc explanations to interpret model outcomes and validate them against domain knowledge. Leveraging the GradCAM post-hoc explanation technique on the EEG motor movement/imagery dataset, this work demonstrates that relying solely on accuracy metrics may be inadequate to ensure BCI performance and acceptability. A model trained using all EEG channels of the dataset achieves 72.60% accuracy, while a model trained with motor-imagery/movement-relevant channel data has a statistically insignificant decrease of 1.75%. However, the relevant features for both are very different based on neurophysiological facts. This work demonstrates that integrating domain-specific knowledge with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques emerges as a promising paradigm for validating the neurophysiological basis of model outcomes in BCIs. Our results reveal the significance of neurophysiological validation in evaluating BCI performance, highlighting the potential risks of exclusively relying on performance metrics when selecting models for dependable and transparent BCIs.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781846","Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781846","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Explainable AI;Motor Imagery;EEG","Measurement;Learning systems;Accuracy;Brain modeling;Motors;Electroencephalography;Data models;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Signal to noise ratio","Electroencephalography;Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","25","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After extracting these fragments and merging them into a new set of signals, they are validated using a set of classifiers.

Additionally, a novel NTSPP-CSP combination is developed to produce a 2-channel BCI system which significantly outperforms either approach operating independently and has the potential to outperform a 60 channel BCI involving the CSP approach with no NTSPP.

To predict the visual memorability of media contents such as images and videos has recently become more important because it can affect the design principles for visualization, advertisement, and education using multimedia contents. Previous studies on prediction of the visual memorability have generally exploited visual features (e.g., color intensity, contrast) or semantic information (e.g., class labels) that can be obtained from multimedia contents. Compared to previous work, we propose a novel approach to predict the visual memorability of multimedia contents by exploiting human biological feedback. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded from subjects as human biological feedback during a visual memory task. The collected EEG signals are then used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for prediction of the visual memorability. In our experiment, 21 subjects were recruited to conduct a visual memory task where each subject is asked to answer if he/she correctly remember a particular image 30 minutes after glancing at a set of images sampled from LaMem dataset. Finally, the performance of deep CNNs trained with EEG signals were compared with classical methods such as SVM, LDA, and k- NN algorithms. From the experimental results, we found that 1) a deep CNN-based framework outperforms classical machine learning methods and 2) the performance of the EEG-based framework is comparable to the previous studies which exploit visual features.","2572-7672","978-1-7281-4707-9","10.1109/BCI48061.2020.9061637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9061637","EEG;brain computer interaction (BCI);deep convolutional neural network;visual memorability","Electroencephalography;Visualization;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Testing;Support vector machines;Electrodes","","","","18","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end EEG decoding framework, which employs raw multi-channel EEG as inputs, to boost decoding accuracy by the channel-projection mixed-scale convolutional neural network (CP-MixedNet) aided by amplitude-perturbation data augmentation. Specifically, the first block in CP-MixedNet is designed to learn primary spatial and temporal representations from EEG signals. The mixed-scale convolutional block is then used to capture mixed-scale temporal information, which effectively reduces the number of training parameters when expanding reception fields of the network. Finally, based on the features extracted in previous blocks, the classification block is constructed to classify EEG tasks. The experiments are implemented on two public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and High gamma dataset) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Despite that the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been suggested to offer a new way to observe neural interactions during epilepsy, however, few studies pay attention to alterations of the epileptic functional brain network based on PAC, especially on the $\boldsymbol{\upbeta\!\!-\!\!\upgamma}$ PAC. Therefore, we use scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data of epileptic patients and the $\boldsymbol{\upbeta\!\!-\!\!\upgamma}$ PAC modulation index (MI) to construct functional brain networks to examine variations of neural interactions during different epileptic phases. Statistically, the findings show that between-channel MI values in the post-ictal period significantly increase compared to that in the pre-ictal period, and the between-channel MI value has a close association with the information of phase and amplitude provided by the channels. Importantly, in both the phase-amplitude and amplitude-phase functional brain networks, the average node degree is remarkably higher in the post-ictal period than that in the pre-ictal period, whereas the characteristic path length in the ictal and post-ictal periods is significantly lower than that in the pre-ictal period. Besides, the average betweenness centrality in the post-ictal period is remarkably higher than that in the ictal period. Interestingly, the positive correlations between within-channel MI values and between-channel MI values can be observed during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods. These findings suggest that the $\boldsymbol{\upbeta\!\!-\!\!\upgamma}$ PAC-based functional brain network may provide a novel perspective to understanding alterations of neural interactions during the epileptic evolution, and may contribute to effectively controlling the spread of epileptic seizures.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3379194","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62173310); MOST 2030 Brain Project(grant numbers:2022ZD0208500); Technology Project of Henan Province(grant numbers:222102310031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10475390","Epilepsy;phase-amplitude coupling;modulation index;functional brain network","Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Mathematical models;Noise reduction;Spatial filters","Humans;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Brain;Adult;Male;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Female;Young Adult;Adolescent;Nerve Net;Middle Aged;Child","","","48","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a patient independent sub-frame based approach for the automatic detection of apnea frames using only EEG signal is proposed. Here instead of directly using a whole frame of EEG data, spectro-temporal subframes are used that are obtained by first extracting frequency band limited signals and then dividing each of them into smaller subframes. Next the extracted subframes are fed into the proposed local convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks. The local features thus produced are then processed using the proposed global CNN block to obtain global features. These features are optimized using deep neural network classifier. The method is evaluated on multiple patients taken from a publicly available database. From extensive analysis it is found that the proposed method offers consistently significant performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Often, during such EEG recordings, subjects interacts with the external devices or the researchers in order to reproduce conditions similar to the those usually occurring in the real-life. However, in order to study the concurrent activity in subjects interacting in cooperation or competition activities, the issue of the simultaneous recording of their brain activity became mandatory. The simultaneous recording of hemodynamic or neuroelectric activity of the brain is called ""hyperscanning"". We would like present results obtained by EEG hyperscannings performed on a group of subjects engaged in cooperative games. The EEG hyperscannings have been performed with the simultaneous use of high resolution EEG devices on groups of three and four subjects while they were playing cooperative games. The analysis of such data have been conducted with analysis method that taken into account the particular nature of the data simultaneously gathered from different subjects.. We called these methods hypermethods. In particular, we estimate the concurrent activity in multiple brains of the group and we depicted the causal connections between regions of different brains (hyperconnectivity). The resulting causality patterns will link certain areas of the brain of a subject to the waveforms obtained from the other brain areas of another subject of the same group.

The proposed DL approach is a cascade of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and fully-connected neural networks (CNN-FC). The focus is mainly on three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (background EEG), (pure imagery) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between background EEG and pure imagery (transitional imagery). The study of transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high and low power EEG imagery, respectively. Moreover, the results from the CNN-FC are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure and transitional imagery signals from background EEG. Using sparse of just a few electrode channels (Cz, C3 and C4), mean accuracy reaches 71.52% and 70.27% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) records electrical activity in the brain in a non-invasive manner. Several modern imaging methods including MRI, SPECT, and PET, EEG offer superior tumor-specific diagnoses. This study offers a diagnostic method for identifying if an EEG signal is cancerous or normal. Initially, EEG signals were first used to capture brain data, which was then preprocessed using the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) method. The features of the brain data are then selected using a heuristic assessment. To extract features, a Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is utilized. Furthermore, we suggest a novel BackPropagationMultilayer Convolutional Neural Network (BP-MCNN) approach for BT diagnostics for tumor categorization. A set of database samples was used to provide the neural network with the statistical information that had been extracted from the EEG signal during the training phase. After being trained, a neural network can accurately categorize a test set of samples into normal or cancerous.

Timely and accurate detection of epileptic seizures is crucial for proper diagnosis and effective treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide vital information about brain activity and serve as a valuable tool for epilepsy detection. The methodology opted for this study was an enhanced multilayer feed forward neural network for automatic detection of epilepsy from EEG signals and hence predicting the severity. The authors build a multistage cascaded neural network model for achieving the same. Initially a Simple Artificial Neural Network (SimpleANN) is designed to classify EEG segments into seizure, healthy and interictal. Later a Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MFFNN) is employed for detecting the severity of epileptic patients and hence can be classified into primary and secondary stages. The experimental results showed that the proposed SimpleANN classifier had provided noticeable results, and outperforms all tested classifiers. The study involves the collection of EEG data from a diverse group of patients, including those with epilepsy and healthy individuals. This automated epilepsy identifying system passes through different stages including decomposition, feature extraction for achieving a better performance model. The proposed system was tested and compared with SVM, KNN, MLP and Decision Tree under different measurement metrics. ANN has managed to give an accuracy of 80 - 90% which is significantly higher as compared to other machine learning models. The proposed work can automatically learn complex patterns from EEG data provides an advantage in identifying subtle seizure related features that may not be evident through manual analysis. Furthermore, the model offers real-time capabilities, making it suitable for continuous monitoring of patients at risk of seizures.","","979-8-3503-7613-5","10.1109/SPICES62143.2024.10779881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10779881","Epilepsy;seizure;preprocessing;detailed coefficients;approximation coefficients;EEG;neural net-work","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Epilepsy;Artificial neural networks;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Nonhomogeneous media;Electroencephalography;Feeds;Biological neural networks","","","","21","IEEE","13 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, methods for recognizing and treating depression are lacking in clinical practice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which objectively reflect the internal workings of the brain, is a promising and objective tool for recognizing and diagnosing of depression and enhancing clinical effects. However, previous EEG feature extraction methods have not performed well when exploring the intrinsic characteristics of highly complex and nonstationary EEG signals. To address this issue, we propose a regularization parameter-based improved intrinsic feature extraction method of EEG signals via empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which mines the intrinsic patterns in EEG signals, for depression recognition. Furthermore, our method can effectively solve the problem that EMD fails to extract intrinsic features. In this method, we first select an appropriate regularization parameter to generate the regularization matrix. Next, we calculate the sum of the matrix products of the IMFs and the regularization matrix and leverage the inverse of this matrix to extract the intrinsic features. The classification results of our method on four EEG datasets reached 0.8750, 0.8850, 0.8485 and 0.7768, respectively. In addition, compared with the iEMD method, our method requires less computational costs. These results support our claim that our method can effectively strengthen the depression recognition performance, and our method outperforms state-of-the-art feature extraction approaches.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3221962","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); Project through the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M700423); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072219,61632014,61802159); Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:lzujbky-2021-kb26); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB744600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950447","Depression recognition;EEG;empirical mode decomposition;intrinsic features","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Depression;Physiology;Entropy;Empirical mode decomposition;Data mining","Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Depression;Brain;Recognition, Psychology;Electroencephalography","37","","52","CCBY","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) and its refinement filterbank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) aim at finding features that are informative for classification of the motor imagery class.

Many factors impact system performance, including inadequate training datasets and models’ ignorance of the temporal dependency of brain responses to serial stimuli. Here, we propose a signal model for event-related responses in the EEG evoked with a rapid sequence of stimuli in BCI applications. The model describes the EEG as a superposition of impulse responses time-locked to stimuli corrupted with an autoregressive noise process. The performance of the signal model is assessed in the context of RSVP keyboard, a language-model-assisted EEG-based BCI for typing. EEG data obtained for model calibration from 10 healthy participants are used to fit and compare two models: the proposed sequence-based EEG model and the trial-based feature-class-conditional distribution model that ignores temporal dependencies, which has been used in the previous work. The simulation studies indicate that the earlier model that ignores temporal dependencies may be causing drastic reductions in achievable information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, the proposed model, with better regularization, may achieve improved accuracy with fewer calibration data samples, potentially helping to reduce calibration time. Specifically, results show an average 8.6% increase in (cross-validated) calibration AUC for a single channel of EEG, and 54% increase in the ITR in a typing task.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2903840","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1149570,CNS-1544895,IIS-1715858,IIS-1717654,IIS-1844885); DHHS(grant numbers:90RE5017-02-01); NIH(grant numbers:R01DC009834); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663441","EEG;BCI;signal model;event-related potential;RSVP keyboard","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Data models","Adult;Algorithms;Area Under Curve;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Models, Theoretical;Normal Distribution;Psychomotor Performance;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","8","","23","IEEE","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given that SCMs are symmetric positive definite (SPD), Riemannian geometry is widely utilized to extract classification features. However, calculating distances between SCMs is computationally intensive due to operations like eigenvalue decomposition, and classical optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, cannot be directly applied to Riemannian manifolds, making the computation of the Riemannian mean more complex and reliant on iterative methods or approximations. In this paper, we propose a novel multiclass classification framework that integrates Riemannian geometry and neural networks to mitigate these challenges. The framework comprises two modules: a Riemannian module with multiple branches and a classification module. During training, a fusion loss function is introduced to update the branch corresponding to the true label, while other branches are updated using different loss functions along with the classification module.

At the same time, optimizing the EEG channel combinations is another key issue that substantially affects the SMR feature representations. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to find channels that record important characteristics of MI, most of them select channels in a cumbersome way with low computational efficiency, thereby limiting the practicality of MI-based BCI systems. In this study, we propose the multi-scale optimization (MSO) of spatial patterns, optimizing filter bands over multiple channel sets within CSPs to further improve the performance of MI-based BCI. Specifically, several channel subsets are first heuristically predefined, and then raw EEG data specific to each of these subsets bandpass-filtered at the overlap between a set of filter bands. Further, instead of solving learning problems for each channel subset independently, we propose a multi-view learning based sparse optimization to jointly extract robust CSP features with  $L_{2,1}$ -norm regularization, aiming to capture the shared salient information across multiple related spatial patterns for enhanced classification performance.

"Brain Topology Modeling With EEG-Graphs for Auditory Spatial Attention Detection","S. Cai; T. Schultz; H.

A key solution is the extraction of discriminative features from high-dimensional data, such as multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG). However, to our knowledge, topological relationships between individual channels have not yet been considered in any study. In this work, we introduced a novel architecture that exploits the topology of the human brain to perform auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) from EEG signals. Methods: We propose EEG-Graph Net, an EEG-graph convolutional network, which employs a neural attention mechanism. This mechanism models the topology of the human brain in terms of the spatial pattern of EEG signals as a graph. In the EEG-Graph, each EEG channel is represented by a node, while the relationship between two EEG channels is represented by an edge between the respective nodes. The convolutional network takes the multi-channel EEG signals as a time series of EEG-graphs and learns the node and edge weights from the contribution of the EEG signals to the ASAD task. The proposed architecture supports the interpretation of the experimental results by data visualization. Results: We conducted experiments on two publicly available databases. The experimental results showed that EEG-Graph Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of decoding performance. In addition, the analysis of the learned weight patterns provides insights into the processing of continuous speech in the brain and confirms findings from neuroscientific studies. Conclusion: We showed that modeling brain topology with EEG-graphs yields highly competitive results for auditory spatial attention detection. Significance: The proposed EEG-Graph Net is more lightweight and accurate than competing baselines and provides explanations for the results. Also, the architecture can be easily transferred to other brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2023.3294242","Agency for Science, Technology and Research; RIE 2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering Programmatic(grant numbers:A1687b0033); Internal Project of Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(grant numbers:T00120220002); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Big Data Computing, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen(grant numbers:B10120210117-KP02); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; University of Bremen, Germany; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271432); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10178086","Auditory spatial attention;brain-computer interface;channel-wise attention;electroencephalography;graph convolutional network","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Decoding;Topology;Convolutional neural networks;Feature extraction;Auditory system;Brain-computer interfaces;Graph convolutional networks","Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces","14","","68","CCBY","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, EEG signals exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to various artifacts originating from other physiological sources. To enhance the classification performance of motor imagery tasks by increasing the SNR of EEG signals, several signal decomposition approaches have been proposed. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has shown promising results in extracting EEG components associated with motor imagery tasks more effectively than traditional linear decomposition algorithms such as Fourier and wavelet methods. Nevertheless, the EMD-based algorithm suffers from a significant challenge known as mode mixing, where frequency components intertwine with the intrinsic mode functions obtained through EMD. This issue severely hampers the accuracy of motor imagery classification. Despite numerous algorithms proposed, mode mixing remains a persistent issue. In this paper, we propose the Deep-EMD algorithm, a deep neural network-based approach to mode mixing problem. We employ two datasets to compare the motor imagery classification and mode mixing improvement achieved by the conventional EMD algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Deep-EMD algorithm effectively mitigates the mode mixing problem in decomposed EEG components, leading to improved motor imagery classification performance.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3432102","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:RS-2022-00165231); Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) through the Development of Quantitative Emotion-Sensibility Evaluation Model of Non-Face-To-Face Environment Users and Commercialization of Interactive Digital Contents Application(grant numbers:RS-2023-00229800); Research Grant of Kwangwoon University, in 2024; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10606308","Brain-computer interface (BCI);deep neural networks;empirical mode decomposition;motor imagery (MI)","Electroencephalography;Motors;Training;Noise;Gaussian noise;Empirical mode decomposition;Signal to noise ratio","Humans;Electroencephalography;Imagination;Algorithms;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Neural Networks, Computer;Deep Learning;Artifacts;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","1","","55","CCBY","22 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most often, these abnormalities are initially overlooked using traditional concussion assessment tools. Accordingly, premature return to sport participation may lead to recurrent episodes of concussion, increasing the risk of recurrent concussions with more severe consequences. Sixty-one athletes at high risk for concussion (i.e., collegiate rugby and football players) were recruited and underwent EEG baseline assessment. Thirty of these athletes suffered from concussion and were retested at day 30 postinjury. A number of task-related EEG recordings were conducted. A novel classification algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), was applied as a classifier to identify residual functional abnormalities in athletes suffering from concussion using a multichannel EEG data set. The total accuracy of the classifier using the 10 features was 77.1%. The classifier has a high sensitivity of 96.7% (linear SVM), 80.0% (nonlinear SVM), and a relatively lower but acceptable selectivity of 69.1% (linear SVM) and 75.0% (nonlinear SVM). The major findings of this report are as follows: 1) discriminative features were observed at theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, 2) the minimal redundancy relevance method was identified as being superior to the univariate -test method in selecting features for the model calculation, 3) the EEG features selected for the classification model are linked to temporal and occipital areas, and 4) postural parameters influence EEG data set and can be used as discriminative features for the classification model. Overall, this report provides sufficient evidence that 10 EEG features selected for final analysis and SVM may be potentially used in clinical practice for automatic classification of athletes with residual brain functional abnormalities following a concussion episode.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2008.918422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454229","Electroencephalography (EEG);feature selection;mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI);support vector machine (SVM);EEG;MTBI;SVM;Feature Selection","Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Brain injuries;Brain modeling;Frequency;Recruitment;Classification algorithms;Lab-on-a-chip;Systems engineering and theory","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Athletic Injuries;Brain Concussion;Brain Mapping;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","56","","54","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown great potential in EEG analysis due to their ability to capture the complex dynamic properties of biological neurons while also processing stimulus information through precisely timed spike trains. However, most existing methods do not effectively mine the specific spatial topology of EEG channels and temporal dependencies of the encoded EEG spikes. Moreover, most are designed for specific BCI tasks and lack some generality. Hence, this study presents a novel SNN model with the customized spike-based adaptive graph convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM), termed SGLNet, for EEG-based BCIs. Specifically, we first adopt a learnable spike encoder to convert the raw EEG signals into spike trains. Then, we tailor the concepts of the multi-head adaptive graph convolution to SNN so that it can make good use of the intrinsic spatial topology information among distinct EEG channels. Finally, we design the spike-based LSTM units to further capture the temporal dependencies of the spikes. We evaluate our proposed model on two publicly available datasets from two representative fields of BCI, notably emotion recognition, and motor imagery decoding. The empirical evaluations demonstrate that SGLNet consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art EEG classification algorithms. This work provides a new perspective for exploring high-performance SNNs for future BCIs with rich spatiotemporal dynamics.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3246989","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62136004,61876082,61732006); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC2001600,2018YFC2001602); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NP2022451); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049464","EEG classification;brain-computer interface;spiking neural network;graph convolution;LSTM","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Neurons;Convolution;Task analysis;Biological system modeling;Micromechanical devices","","31","","53","CCBY","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GSP is an extension of classical signal processing methods to complex networks where there exists an inherent relation graph. With the help of GSP, we propose a new framework for learning class-specific discriminative graphs. To that end, firstly we assume for each class of observations there exists a latent underlying graph representation. Secondly, we consider the observations are smooth on their corresponding class-specific sough graph while they are non-smooth on other classes’ graphs. The learned class-specific graph-based representations can act as sub-dictionaries and be utilized for the task of emotion classification.

The mean online accuracy is 80%±15% for the former and 67%±12% for the latter. Second, a more thorough investigation is done by evaluating the system for frequencies within a set of 35Hz-40Hz. Although the mean accuracy, 64% ± 22%, is relatively low, most of the users were able to achieve satisfying accuracy, with the mean reaching 82%±5%, which would allow for an efficient, and yet pleasant, usage of the BCI system.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for feature extraction of EEG signals based on multi-band brain mapping using EMD, where the EMD is applied to decompose an EEG signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The obtained multi-band brain mapping is used to reconstruct the neuronal activity of the brain. The impact of signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the EMD frequency bands separation is explored and the results shows the strength of the EMD in adaptively separating the noise.

The data is from 5 arousal states - wakeful and four sleep stages (N1, N2, N3 and REM). Our pipeline uses an Ada Boost model for classification on a challenging early stage PD classification task with with only 30 participants (11 PD, 19 Healthy Control). Evaluating 9 brain connectivity metrics we find the best connectivity metric to be different for each arousal state with Phase Lag Index achieving the highest in-dividual classification accuracy of 86% on N1 data. Further to this our pipeline using regional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78%, using brain connectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86% whereas combining the two achieves a best accuracy of 91%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data using Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency characteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 % and precision of 96%. Furthermore we find that o n data from each arousal state, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification accuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we conclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG statistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's. Additionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of Parkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD.

However, most current EEG signal classification algorithms for controlling rehabilitation robots exhibit several drawbacks, including a lack of novelty, insufficient classification accuracy and poor adaptability to different experimental paradigms. Therefore, we designed a new deep-learning method to classify EEG signals to enhance the effectiveness of BCI control of rehabilitation robots. Here we apply this method to classify EEG signals and control the rehabilitation robot to accomplish a target task. In addition, we compare our algorithm with several different EEG signal classification algorithms in two experimental paradigms: motor imagery and motor execution. Our deep learning method has the highest offline accuracy of 72.7% and an average accuracy of 72.4% under the motor imagery experimental paradigm, and the highest offline accuracy of 97.5% and an average accuracy of 90.4% under the motor execution experimental paradigm.

Oddball paradigms are used in BCI to generate event-related potentials (ERPs), like the P300 wave, on targets selected by the user. A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300 waves allows the user to write characters. The P300 speller is composed of two classification problems. The first classification is to detect the presence of a P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The second one corresponds to the combination of different P300 responses for determining the right character to spell. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The topology of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 waves in the time domain. Seven classifiers based on the CNN are proposed: four single classifiers with different features set and three multiclassifiers. These models are tested and compared on the Data set II of the third BCI competition. The best result is obtained with a multiclassifier solution with a recognition rate of 95.5 percent, without channel selection before the classification.

The gold standard of sleep wake assessment is achieved by recording brain electroencephalogram (EEG), which not only allows for standard sleep staging but also allows further signal processing through quantitative EEG methods. Conventional methods of sleep staging require manual scoring by a trained expert. Here, a 1-D deep convolutional neural network (Deep CNN) is proposed to automatically score sleep stages and identify mTBI from a single-channel EEG signal with duration of 64 seconds by classifying the EEG signal into one of four classes: sham (control) wake, sham (control) sleep, mTBI wake, and mTBI sleep.

In this paper, the authors propose a new type of neural network (NN) model referred to as a sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition neural network (SRNN) which enables one to detect several kinds of important characteristic waves in sleep EEG which are necessary for diagnosing sleep stages.

However, these systems do not necessarily capture the chaoticity of EEG signals, and hence, may affect the accuracy of classification. Furthermore, most recent EEG-based BCI systems involve nonlinear feature extraction; however, these systems require explicit and hand-selection of these features, and may therefore impose further errors. In this study, we investigate the use of deep learning techniques that involve inherent and embedded feature selection and extraction in their hidden layers, and hence, they do not require explicit and human-intervened selection of features. The performance of different deep learning models were compared to those of the traditional classifiers. Results show that deep learning-based BCI systems performed significantly better in comparison to the conventional classifiers.

This study utilized a state-of-the-art GNN variant with GNNexplainer to find relevant connectivity during mental arithmetic (MA) tasks. In this endeavor, MA EEG recordings were retrieved from an openaccess database. The signals were transformed to graph data through the envelope correlation and power spectral density (PSD), and subjected to GNN with hierarchical graph pooling with a structure learning model to classify MA and baseline (BL). The model accuracy was $85.57 \pm 6.27$ and $96.26 \pm 4.14$% for the connectivity dataset and the PSD and the connectivity feature, respectively. Among the connections between nodes identified as important by GNNExplainer, two notable edge patterns were found as 1) from the left centro-parietal region to left frontal regions, and 2) the frontoparietal connection. The results indicate 1) the GNN model performance could be improved using the connectivity and PSD feature together, and 2) characteristic patterns of the connectome and PSD could be important for MA classification.

For all the predictors, uniform quantization is applied on the residue signals obtained as the difference between the original and the predicted values. The maximum allowable reconstruction error delta is varied to determine the theoretical bound delta0 for near-lossless compression and the corresponding bit rate rp. It is shown that among all the predictors, the SLP yields the best results in achieving the lowest values for delta0 and rp. The corresponding values of the fidelity parameters, namely, percent of root-mean-square difference, peak SNR and cross correlation are also determined. A compression efficiency of 82.8% is achieved using the SLP with a near-lossless bound delta0=3, with the diagnostic quality of the reconstructed EEG signal preserved. Thus, the proposed near-lossless scheme facilitates transmission of real time as well as offline EEG signals over network to remote interpretation center economically with less bandwidth utilization compared to other known lossless and near-lossless schemes.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2007.899497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358888","EEG;near-lossless compression;neural network;prediction;uniform quantization;EEG;near loss compression;neural network;prediction;uniform quantization","Neural networks;Electroencephalography;Multilayer perceptrons;Finite impulse response filter;Multi-layer neural network;Brain modeling;Predictive models;Nonlinear filters;Quantization;Bit rate","Electroencephalography;Neural Networks (Computer)","51","","25","IEEE","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To attain this objective, a brain-computer interface that is EEG-based and that is activated by mental tasks is proposed. The system is custom designed for each subject. For each subject, the most discriminatory mental task that yields a zero false activation rate is determined. By keeping the false positive rate at zero, the number of channels needed is reduced. We show that we can obtain a false positive rate of zero value and a true positive rate in the range of 71.96% to 77.61% with only three electrode channels.

Developing an EEG-based detection system for patients with epilepsy is vital for clinical management and targeted therapy. Methods: This paper proposes a single-channel seizure detection system using brain-rhythmic recurrence biomarkers (BRRM) and an optimized model (ONASNet). BRRM is a direct mapping of the recurrence morphology of brain rhythms in phase space; it reflects the nonlinear dynamics of original EEG signals. The architecture of ONASNet is determined through a modified neural network searching strategy. Then, we exploited transfer learning to apply ONASNet to our EEG data. The combination of BRRM and ONASNet leverages the multiple channels of a neural network to extract features from different brain rhythms simultaneously. Results: We evaluated the efficiency of BRRM-ONASNet on the real EEG recordings derived from Bonn University. In the experiments, different transfer-learning models (TLMs) are respectively constructed using ONASNet and seven well-known neural network structures (VGG16/VGG19/ResNet50/InceptionV3/DenseNet121/Xception/NASNet). Moreover, we compared those TLMs by model size, computing complexity, learning capability, and prediction latency. ONASNet outperforms other structures by strong learning capability, high stability, small model size, short latency, and less requirement of computing resources. Comparing BRRM-ONASNet with other existing methods, our work performs better than others with 100% accuracy under the identical dataset and same detection task.

For target with response, high connectivity was observed for all cases in general for all segments compared with other cases. TNR has less connectivity than TR cases for all segments. High connectivity was observed only in the first segment for NTNR case. For 10-20 electrodes FC can be observed for Fz, F3, F4, C3 or C4 electrodes. C3 or C4 electrodes locations are responsible for motor planning or sensorimotor integrations in the last segment when subject responds to the target or nontarget stimuli. Hence using this method, it is possible to identify the individual differences between different oddball cases within and across subjects using single trial EEG as a function of time.","","978-1-5386-0389-5","10.1109/CSPA.2018.8368714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368714","Electroencephalography;Functional connectivity;Correlation;Behavior analysis;Single trial","Electrodes;Correlation;Electroencephalography;Scalp;Signal processing;Correlation coefficient;Brain","","3","","14","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it will be time consuming and an exhausting experience if the single command translation from large number of electrodes is used. The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that can choose optimal four electrodes for signal recording, and convert one thought into multiple commands with the chosen electrodes. Using sample datasets, the EEG signal is analyzed to determine the most suitable scalp area for P300 detection, while optimization with genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to select best four channels. After 30 GA runs, the optimal four sets of electrodes are chosen based on their coefficient of determination or r2 values, where higher values contributes to higher repetition rates. Using signals from the chosen four electrodes, a success rate of 75-80% is received.","","978-1-4799-7910-3","10.1109/ICAIET.2014.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351819","Brain-Computer Interface; Genetic Algorithm; EEG; P300","Electrodes;Genetic algorithms;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Optimization","","4","","23","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, SDMA-BCI based on EEG had poor system performance limited by spatial resolution. MEG-EEG fusion modality analysis can help solve this problem. According retina-cortical relationship, this study used stimulus out of the central visual field and tiny fixation points to construct a 16-command SDMA coded MEG-EEG fusion modality BCI system. We achieved this by synchronously acquiring MEG and EEG signals from 10 subjects. We compared the spatiotemporal features between MEG and EEG by analyzing signals in the occipital region. We fused MEG and EEG modalities without any signal processing and used the multi-class discriminative canonical pattern matching (Multi-DCPM) algorithm to evaluate and compare the system performance of EEG, MEG, and MEG-EEG fusion modalities. The result showed that MEG and EEG had obvious differences in spatial distribution characteristics. MEG improves offline classification accuracy of the 16 fixation points by 27.81% over EEG at 4s data length. Specially, the MEG-EEG fusion modality achieves an impressive average offline accuracy of 91.71%, which was a significant improvement over MEG (p<0.01, ANOVA). The MEG-EEG fusion modality achieved average information transfer rate (ITR) of 60.74 bits/min with a data length of 1 s, which was a 14% improvement over MEG. The MEG-EEG fusion modality significantly enhanced the spatial features and performance of SDMA-encoded BCIs. These results highlight the potential and feasibility of MEG-EEG fusion modality BCI, and provide theoretical insights and practical value for promoting the further development and application of SDMA in BCI.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3550653","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFF1203900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62122059,81925020,62106170,82101274,82472101); Introduce Innovative Teams of 2021 “New High School 20 Items” Project(grant numbers:2021GXRC071); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2022ZD0211901,2019YFA0707103,2020AAA0105601); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:31730039,U21A20388); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:ZDBS-LY-SM028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10924429","Magnetoencephalography (MEG);electroencephalography (EEG);brain–computer interface (BCI);spatial division multiple access (SDMA)","Electroencephalography;Visualization;Encoding;Fluctuations;Spatial resolution;Accuracy;Multiaccess communication;Data acquisition;Standards;SQUID magnetometers","Humans;Electroencephalography;Magnetoencephalography;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Algorithms;Male;Adult;Female;Young Adult;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Photic Stimulation","","","40","CCBY","12 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Single-modal noninvasive brain signals have limitations, such as low spatial resolution or low temporal resolution, while multimodal brain signal acquisition and processing can overcome these limitations. Electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) is a method with advantages in multimodal brain signal processing, but current fusion methods mostly use manual feature extraction or channel selection, which may lead to the loss of important information during the feature extraction or channel selection process in real-time BCI systems. In order to solve this issue, this article proposes an innovative fusion analysis method for EEG-fNIRS multimodal brain signals, using a hybrid algorithm that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and Attention mechanisms for signal classification. The method first preprocesses the EEG and fNIRS signals separately, then extracts features using spatial-temporal convolutional layers, and finally merges them to obtain the classification results through dual attention calculation. Our method is validated on two publicly available mixed EEG-fNIRS BCI datasets, including three types of experimental tasks that do not involve actual movement: motor imagery (MI), mental arithmetic, and word generation (WG). The accuracy rates for each task reached 92.2% for MI, 98.6% for mental arithmetic, and 95.2% for WG, respectively. These rates have surpassed all the current methods. This indicates that our proposed method achieves better classification performance in non-actual movement classification tasks under the premise of lightweight. The method proposed in this study can be applied to the field of rapid and efficient identification of brain signals.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2025.3538086","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62303299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10886982","Attention;brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS);motor imagery (MI)","Feature extraction;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Data mining;Brain modeling;Training;Accuracy;Transformers;Optical variables measurement;Signal processing algorithms","","","","46","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most research on EEG-based BCIs focuses on the accurate decoding of EEG signals; however, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, and so on, which should be protected. This paper first exposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in EEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the same user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information. To address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the original EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user identity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI task. Experiments on seven EEG datasets from five different BCI paradigms showed that on average the generated identity-unlearnable EEG data can reduce the user identification accuracy from 70.01% to at most 21.36%, greatly facilitating user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3310883","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFE0204700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236508","Brain–computer interfaces;machine learning;privacy protection","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Perturbation methods;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Data privacy;Privacy","Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Brain;Communication","7","","38","CCBY","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this thesis, a novel motor imagery algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy rate and computational efficiency at the same time. The architecture of many BCI system is quite complex and they involve time consuming processing. The electroencephalography (EEG) signal is the most commonly used inputs for BCI applications but EEG is often contaminated with noise. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper we use the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction from EEG and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for motor imagery classification. In this study, CSP and LDA have been used to reduce the artifact and classify Mi-based EEG signal. We have used two-level cross validation scheme to determine the subject specific best time window and number of CSP features.

However, deep learning-based methods still face two challenging problems in practical MI EEG signal classification applications: (1) Generally, training a deep learning model successfully needs a large amount of labeled data. However, most of the EEG signal data is unlabeled and it is quite difficult or even impossible for human experts to label all the signal samples manually. (2) It is extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive to train a deep learning model from scratch. To cope with these two challenges, a deep transfer convolutional neural network (CNN) framework based on VGG-16 is proposed for EEG signal classification. The proposed framework consists of a VGG-16 CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet and a target CNN model which shares the same structure with VGG-16 except for the softmax output layer. The parameters of the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model are directly transferred to the target CNN model used for MI EEG signal classification. Then, front-layers parameters in the target model are frozen, while later-layers parameters are fine-tuned by the target MI dataset. The target dataset is composed of time-frequency spectrum images of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed framework is verified on the public benchmark dataset 2b from the BCI competition IV. The experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy and efficiency performance of EEG signal classification compared with traditional methods, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and standard CNN.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930958","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573257,71690234); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8772136","Motor imagery (MI);electroencephalogram (EEG);signal classification;short time Fourier transform (STFT);VGG-16;transfer learning","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Time-frequency analysis;Deep learning","","164","","40","CCBY","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies have shown the possibilities of decoding covert speech from non-invasive techniques such as electroencephalogram (EEG). Decoding covert speech from EEG may find broader applications than invasive approaches, but it poses additional challenges due to its less distinct speech-related brain patterns compared with overt speech. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge transfer framework to build a pretrained model for covert speech from overt speech, including both EEG and audio data. We further integrate acoustic features to enforce a direct neural-to-phonetic mapping from EEG signals to audio representations using data from other subjects. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained model with covert EEG from the target subjects for decoding. To validate the proposed strategy, we test it on our covert/overt EEG dataset collected from 54 subjects with concurrent EEG and audio recording. Results show that the proposed framework outperforms SOTA methods in terms of classification accuracy of covert speech decoding using EEG.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-6874-1","10.1109/ICASSP49660.2025.10889189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10889189","Brain Computer Interface (BCI);EEG;Covert speech decoding;Pretraining;Classification","Speech enhancement;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Audio recording;Electroencephalography;Acoustics;Data models;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Knowledge transfer","","","","32","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1) a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2) it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the system's practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors, namely, SBLaplace, for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2476656","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research through the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:15K15955,26730125); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61201124,61202155,61203127,61305028,61573142,91420302); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WG1414005,WH1314023,WH1414022); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014A030308009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274734","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);event-related potential (ERP);Laplace prior;sparse Bayesian classification","Electroencephalography;Bayes methods;Brain modeling;Training;Support vector machines;Training data;Classification algorithms","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer)","212","","65","IEEE","23 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have acquired EEG data from 20 subjects using oddball experiment to investigate the flow pattern of EEG signal (activity) across brain lobes during a specific activity. The EEG data is converted into EEG topographic maps (topo-map). The flow of EEG activity between consecutive topo-maps is estimated by using flow of brightness pattern in an image. A tracking algorithm is developed by tracking the motion vectors to examine the flow of EEG signal that depends on the overlapping of the motion field between current frame and next frames. The motion field is generated and the result of tracking is compared with full search (FS) block matching motion estimation algorithm.

For the first time, the node-influence properties from graph theory are incorporated to alter the way different EEG samples influence the training, while an ensemble of semantic graphs is used in the NSL module to capture different semantic relations between the EEG trial data. The proposed model is assessed on the standard BCI IV 2a dataset. On comparing its test accuracies with the traditional Riemannian classifiers and the baseline NSL, we have found improved accuracies over all subjects.

Many machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used to classify EEG signals. Besides, many studies have involved the time and frequency domain features to classify EEG signals. On the other hand, a very limited number of studies combine the spatial and temporal dimensions of the EEG signal. Brain dynamics are very complex across different mental tasks, thus it is difficult to design efficient algorithms with features based on prior knowledge. Therefore, in this study, we utilized the 2D AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn EEG features across different mental tasks without prior knowledge. First, this study adds spatial and temporal dimensions of EEG signals to a 2D EEG topographic map. Second, topographic maps at different time indices were cascaded to populate a 2D image for a given time window. Finally, the topographic maps enabled the AlexNet to learn features from the spatial and temporal dimensions of the brain signals. The classification performance was obtained by the proposed method on a multiclass dataset from BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The proposed system obtained an average classification accuracy of 81.09%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 4% for the same dataset. The results showed that converting the EEG classification problem from a (1D) time series to a (2D) image classification problem improves the classification accuracy for BCI systems. Also, our EEG topographic maps enabled CNN to learn subtle features from spatial and temporal dimensions, which better represent mental tasks than individual time or frequency domain features.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175894","","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Two dimensional displays;Training;Feature extraction;Shape;Electrodes","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","24","","17","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning provides a promising technique to optimize EEG patterns toward better decoding accuracy. However, existing algorithms do not effectively explore the underlying data structure capturing the true EEG sample distribution and, hence, can only yield a suboptimal decoding accuracy. To uncover the intrinsic distribution structure of EEG data, we propose a clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm for improved EEG pattern decoding. Specifically, we perform affinity propagation-based clustering to explore the subclasses (i.e., clusters) in each of the original classes and then assign each subclass a unique label based on a one-versus-all encoding strategy. With the encoded label matrix, we devise a novel multitask learning algorithm by exploiting the subclass relationship to jointly optimize the EEG pattern features from the uncovered subclasses. We then train a linear support vector machine with the optimized features for EEG pattern decoding. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on three EEG data sets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. The improved experimental results demonstrate the outstanding superiority of our algorithm, suggesting its prominent performance for EEG pattern decoding in BCI applications.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3053576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349966","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);multitask learning;pattern decoding;subclass regularization","Electroencephalography;Decoding;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Optimization;Data mining;Sparse matrices","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","24","","77","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several methods have been proposed for end-to-end denoising using deep learning networks recently, but effectively improving the accuracy and robustness of denoising remains a great challenge.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals captured during motor imagery tasks offer valuable insights into the intention to execute specific movements. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes a Divergence-based Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for classifying motor imagery EEG signals. The DCNN aims to augment the network’s discriminative power and enhance classification accuracy. The proposed approach incorporates three main components: Daubechies wavelet transform, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), and CNN model. The Daubechies wavelet transform is employed to extract relevant features from the EEG signals. CSP is utilized to select discriminative features that capture the differences between motor imagery tasks, finally the CNN model is trained to classify the EEG signals into different motor imagery categories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCNN surpasses baseline CNN models and achieves higher accuracy in classifying motor imagery EEG signals. Furthermore, the DCNN exhibits robustness to variations in EEG signal characteristics with accuracy of $85 \%$ while the existing methods classifies with accuracy of 79%. The findings suggest that the integration of divergence-based regularization within the DCNN architecture holds promise for enhancing the classification performance of motor imagery-based BCIs. The proposed approach has the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable BCIs, thereby facilitating improved communication and control for individuals with motor disabilities.","2473-7674","979-8-3503-7024-9","10.1109/ICCCNT61001.2024.10724861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10724861","CNN;EEG signals;DCNN architecture;Brain coding Interface","Wavelet transforms;Accuracy;Image coding;Neural engineering;Motors;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Robustness;Convolutional neural networks","","","","31","IEEE","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current ErrP-BCI cannot distinguish the prediction error is induced by user’s own (first-person perspective, 1PP) or other’s (third-person perspective, 3PP) wrong action, hindering it from being applied in social interactions. This study used virtual reality (VR) to make subjects aware of prediction errors from the first- or third-person perspective, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 22 healthy subjects. Event-related potential (ERP), event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), inter-trial coherence (ITC) and shrinkage discriminant canonical pattern matching (SKDCPM) algorithm were used to investigate EEG features and the separability of prediction errors induced by distinct perspectives. Consequently, ErrP induced by the 1PP emerged significantly earlier than that of 3PP, and caused greater ERSP and ITC in the prefrontal region in the theta and alpha bands. Decoding result achieved 76.4%± 9.13% accuracy for the two types of errors (1PP-incorrect vs 3PP-incorrect).

One of the major challenges in realization of the EEG signals is the long calibration time required since they show significant variations between recording sessions even for the same subject within the same experimental condition. This paper proposes a score-based adaptive training algorithm that maximally utilizes relevant information from prior recording sessions and significantly shortens the calibration time. Also the proposed method is suitable to develop real-time, wearable, and low-power BCI embedded devices.

A motor imagery (MI)-BCI based visual-haptic neurofeedback training (NFT) experiment was designed with sixteen participants. EEG and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were simultaneously recorded before and after this transient NFT. Cortical activation was significantly improved after repeated and continuous NFT through time-frequency and topological analysis. A classifier calibration strategy, weighted EEG-fNIRS patterns (WENP), was proposed, in which elementary classifiers were constructed by using both the EEG and fNIRS information and then integrated into a strong classifier with their independent accuracy-based weight assessment. The results revealed that the classifier constructed on integrating EEG and fNIRS patterns was significantly superior to that only with independent information ( $\sim $ 10% and  $\sim $ 18% improvement respectively), reaching  $\sim $ 89% in mean classification accuracy. The WENP is a classifier calibration strategy that can effectively improve the performance of the MI-BCI and could also be used to other BCI paradigms.

The main problem in the use of EEG signals is that are often contaminated by physiological and non-physiological artifacts. EOG (electrooculogram) artifact is one of the first origins of artifacts in EEG recordings. It severely affects the EEG signal and modifies the shape of the neural activity that drive the BCI system affecting then its accuracy and performance. This paper presents an original algorithm to detect and remove EOG artifacts from EEG signals. In the proposed method, the statistical parameters extracted from the signal are used as the inputs of a fuzzy inference system to take a decision if an epoch of EEG is contaminated by the EOG or not. Thereafter, the level-5 stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is applied on the detected contaminated epochs to remove the artifacts without bringing much distortion to the neural activity. The performance of the developed algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios: semi-simulated artifactual EEG data and fully real artifactual EEG data. The presented results show that our algorithm outperforms some existing algorithms.","","978-1-6654-9807-4","10.1109/ICAC55051.2022.9911068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911068","Brain computer interface;Fuzzy logic;biomedical signal processing;artifact handling;wavelet transform","Wavelet transforms;Fuzzy logic;Electrooculography;Shape;Neural activity;Signal processing algorithms;Electroencephalography","","5","","33","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, an increasing number of neural network approaches have been proposed to recognize EEG signals. However, these approaches depend heavily on using complex network structures to improve the performance of EEG recognition and suffer from the deficit of training data. Inspired by the waveform characteristics and processing methods shared between EEG and speech signals, we propose Speech2EEG, a novel EEG recognition method that leverages pretrained speech features to improve the accuracy of EEG recognition. Specifically, a pretrained speech processing model is adapted to the EEG domain to extract multichannel temporal embeddings. Then, several aggregation methods, including the weighted average, channelwise aggregation, and channel-and-depthwise aggregation, are implemented to exploit and integrate the multichannel temporal embeddings. Finally, a classification network is used to predict EEG categories based on the integrated features. Our work is the first to explore the use of pretrained speech models for EEG signal analysis as well as the effective ways to integrate the multichannel temporal embeddings from the EEG signal. Extensive experimental results suggest that the proposed Speech2EEG method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging motor imagery (MI) datasets, the BCI IV-2a and BCI IV-2b datasets, with accuracies of  ${89}.{5}\%$  and  ${84}.{07}\%$ , respectively. Visualization analysis of the multichannel temporal embeddings show that the Speech2EEG architecture can capture useful patterns related to MI categories, which can provide a novel solution for subsequent research under the constraints of a limited dataset scale.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3268751","Australian Research Council (ARC) under Discovery(grant numbers:DP210101093,Discovery DP220100803); University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Human-Centric Al Centre by GrapheneX (2023-2031); Australia Defence Innovation Hub under Contract(grant numbers:P18-650825); Australian Cooperative Research Centers Projects (CRC-P) Round 11(grant numbers:CRCPXI000007); U.S. Office of Naval Research Global Cooperative under Agreement(grant numbers:ONRGNICOP-N62909-19-1-2058); US Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Defence Science and Technology (AFOSR-DST) Australian Autonomy Initiative(grant numbers:ID10134); NSW Defence Innovation Network and NSW State Government of Australia(grant numbers:DINPP2019 S1-03/09,PP21-22.03.02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106018","Transfer learning;motor imagery;electroencephalogram","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Convolution;Speech recognition;Speech processing;Training","Humans;Speech;Imagination;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Neural Networks, Computer;Electroencephalography;Algorithms","10","","110","CCBYNCND","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An early and precise diagnosis of a brain tumor is crucial for the effective administration of the remedy. Brain tumors can start outside the brain and spread there, or it can start inside the brain and grow there. Headaches, nausea, and balance issues are some of the indications and symptoms that the tumor can produce as it spreads because it puts pressure on the surrounding brain tissue and alters how it functions. Early tumor detection minimizes the need for surgery and other forms of treatment, improving the prognosis for many patients. The development of new technologies that improve neurosurgery’s success rate and avoid problems is still ongoing today. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRr) is one of the most often utilized procedures for analyzing pictures of brain tumors [6]. EEG signal is used in the suggested method to forecast brain tumors.

These applications need to know the personal features of users, such as their gender, to improve the user experience. Notably, therefore, it is possible to categorize gender based on speech and facial characteristics. Additionally, instead of considering body part features, gender prediction based on physiological measurements such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provides a strong and reliable method for an automatic gender classification system. EEG signals record brain activity from the outer scalp, which means they are contaminated by external and internal noise. Therefore, designing an effective gender detection mechanism based on EEG data is challenging because gender-related EEG features must be captured accurately. In this paper, we investigated the effect of emotions on a gender prediction system using EEG data in negative and positive emotional states. We proposed a model that extracts the power spectral density features of EEG signals in emotional states and predicts gender using three classifiers: decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron. Furthermore, we studied the effect of omitting a single electrode and multiple electrodes in the EEG data on the proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using emotional state EEG data to identify gender. Furthermore, the random forest classifier achieved the lowest percentage error of 7% based on negative emotion EEG signal. Finally, the results revealed that the brain’s frontal lobe has a high level of success in enabling differentiation between males and females.","","978-1-6654-3904-6","10.1109/ICSIP52628.2021.9688884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688884","Classification;gender;emotions;random forest;MLP;EEG signals","Electrodes;Frontal lobe;Biometrics (access control);Databases;Multilayer perceptrons;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","4","","25","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a person initializes his brain to say something, an image of the word or alphabets are portrayed at the back of his mind. This process has been done less than a second that's why no one can notice this through a naked eye, scientifically, it is proved that anything a man thinks or tries to convey is stored in subconscious mind in the form of an image. Every alphabet thought in mind results with the slight change in the Electroencephalogram of the person. This slight change distinguished and used to make this project working. The suggested method investigates the usefulness of Time - Frequency Analysis as a methodology for classifying various alphabets using electroencephalogram (EEG). For signal acquisition the Electrodes are placed on a subject scalp followed by Instrumentation amplifier which consisting of two stage amplifier i.e., (OPAMP INA118 and TL082), optocoupler subject projection circuit has also been designed for the safety of circuit and the subject too, along with these circuitry Right Driven Leg circuit has also designed to reduce Common-mode interference during acquiring the brain EEG signal from a subject.

So far, Transformer-based approaches have not been widely explored in motor-imagery EEG classification and visualization, especially lacking general models based on cross-individual validation. Taking advantage of the Transformer model and the spatial-temporal characteristics of the EEG signals, we designed Transformer-based models for classifications of motor imagery EEG based on the PhysioNet dataset. With 3s EEG data, our models obtained the best classification accuracy of 83.31%, 74.44%, and 64.22% on two-, three-, and four-class motor-imagery tasks in cross-individual validation, which outperformed other state-of-the-art models by 0.88%, 2.11%, and 1.06%. The inclusion of the positional embedding modules in the Transformer could improve the EEG classification performance. Furthermore, the visualization results of attention weights provided insights into the working mechanism of the Transformer-based networks during motor imagery tasks. The topography of the attention weights revealed a pattern of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which was consistent with the results from the spectral analysis of Mu and beta rhythm over the sensorimotor areas.

In the first part, the main methods used in the analysis of interictal EEG/MEG epileptiform spikes are presented and discussed. Source and volume conductor models are passed in review, namely the equivalent dipole source concept, the requirements for adequate time and spatial sampling, the question of how to validate source solutions, particularly by comparing solutions obtained using scalp and intracranial EEG signals, EEG & MEG data, or EEG simultaneously recorded with fMRI (BOLD signals). In the second part, methods used for the characterization of seizures are considered, namely dipolar modeling of spikes at seizure onset, decomposition of seizure EEG signals into sets of orthogonal spatio-temporal components, and also methods (linear and nonlinear) of estimating seizure propagation. In the third part, the crucial issue of how the transition between interictal and seizure activity takes place is examined. In particular the vicissitudes of the efforts along the road to seizure prediction are shortly reviewed. It is argued that this question can be reduced to the problem of estimating the excitability state of neuronal populations in the course of time as a seizure approaches. The value of active probing methods in contrast with passive analytical methods is emphasized. In the fourth part modeling aspects are considered in the light of two special kinds of epilepsies, absences characterized by spike-and-wave discharges and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. These two types correspond to different scenarios regarding the transition to epileptic seizures, namely the former is a case of a jump transition and the latter is a typical case of gradual transition. In conclusion, the necessity of developing comprehensive computational models of epileptic seizures is emphasized.

However, due to cortical reorganization, the desynchro-nization potential evoked by the motor imagery of patients with brain lesions is quite different from that evoked by the motor imagery of normal subjects. These differences can be attributed to active cortex regions, frequency bands and amplitude. In this paper, we use a deep learning method to explore the EEG patterns of key channels and the frequency band for stroke patients. The EEG data is bandpass filtered into multiple sub-bands split by a sliding window strategy. Under these sub-bands, diverse spatial-spectral features are extracted and fed into a deep neural network for classification, uncovering the spectral patterns (bandpass filters) and spatial patterns (spatial weights).

Generally, these CNNs capture spatiotemporal features at single spectral resolution. However, epileptiform EEG signals contain irregular neural oscillations of different frequencies in different brain regions. Therefore, it may be underperforming and uninterpretable for the CNNs without capturing complex spectral properties sufficiently. This study proposed a novel interpretable multi-branch architecture for spatiotemporal CNNs, namely MultiSincNet. On the one hand, the MultiSincNet could directly show the frequency boundaries using the interpretable sinc-convolution layers. On the other hand, it could extract and integrate multiple spatiotemporal features across varying spectral resolutions using parallel branches. Moreover, we also constructed a post-hoc explanation technique for multi-branch CNNs, using the first- order Taylor expansion and chain rule based on the multivariate composite function, which demonstrates the crucial spatiotemporal features learned by the proposed multi-branch spatiotemporal CNN. When combined with the optimal MultiSincNet, ShallowConvNet, DeepConvNet, and EEGWaveNet had significantly improved the subject-specific performance on most metrics. Specifically, the optimal MultiSincNet significantly increased the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, binary F1-score, weighted F1-score, and AUC of EEGWaveNet by about 7%, 8%, 7%, 8%, 7%, and 7%, respectively. Besides, the visualization results showed that the optimal model mainly extracts the spectral energy difference from the high gamma band focalized to specific spatial areas as the dominant spatiotemporal EEG feature.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3481005","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFF1203700,2023YFF1203900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62406220,62122059,81925020,82101274); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M742604); Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF(grant numbers:GZC20231916); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10716754","Seizure prediction (SP);electroencephalogram (EEG);spatiotemporal neural networks;post-hoc explanation technique;interpretability","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Convolution;Computer architecture;Convolutional neural networks;Medical diagnostic imaging;Signal resolution;Kernel;Epilepsy","Humans;Electroencephalography;Seizures;Neural Networks, Computer;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Adult;Female;Young Adult;Brain","","","47","IEEE","15 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we employ artificial neural network for modeling the interference. The reference signal was collected by using an electrode placed on the forehead above the eye compared with the conventional eye blink recording which uses two electrodes, one placed above and the other below the eye. The reference signal is also contaminated by the EEG. To reduce the EEG interference, the reference signal is first lowpass filtered by a moving average filter and then applied to the ANC. The results show that single electrode recording provides satisfactory reference input correlated with the noise in the primary signal. The neural ANC is trained with one segment of data and evaluated with the rest of data. It is found that neural ANC provides a perfect cancellation of eye blink interference.

However, due to the irregularity of EEG waveform, it is difficult to directly give the correlation between the patient’s level of consciousness and DOA. From this point of view, in this article, the nonlinear dynamic methods and the frequency-domain methods are combined to analyze EEG, and characteristic parameters are used to analyze the changing trend of the patient’s level of consciousness during general anesthesia.

In this paper, a near- lossless scheme for the compression of EEG signals using artificial neural networks is proposed. The error (residue) signals which is obtained due to the difference between the original and the predicted EEG signals are thresolded based on a term referred as absolute error limit (AEL) such that, any error samples above the limit require more number of bits than the samples below the limit that require less number of bits. The thresholded error samples are quantized in a non-uniform manner by varying the actual bits assigned to the error samples. An arithmetic encoder is further used to improve the compression efficiency. Three adaptive neural network models, namely, single and multilayer perceptrons and Elman neural network and two classical adaptive predictors such as autoregressive model(AR) and normalized least mean-square FIR filter are used. EEG signals recorded under different physiological conditions are considered and the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of compression ratio and the fidelity parameter, percent of root-mean-square-difference (PRD). It is found from the experimental results that the variation of error limit and quantization step decides the overall compression performance. Single- layer perceptron yields the best compression results in terms of utilizing less bit rate as well achieving low PRD values compared to other predictors.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4353019","","Neural networks;Electroencephalography;Quantization;Artificial neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Brain modeling;Predictive models;Arithmetic;Adaptive systems;Multilayer perceptrons","Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Data Compression;Electroencephalography;Humans;Reproducibility of Results;Sample Size;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","10","","27","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large-scale dynamical functional network connectivity (dFNC) provides a more context-sensitive, dynamical, and straightforward sight at a higher network level. Nevertheless, dFNC analysis needs good enough resolution in both temporal and spatial domains, and the construction of dFNC needs to capture the time-varying correlations between two multivariate time series with unmatched spatial dimensions. Effective methods still lack. With well-developed source imaging techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG) has the potential to possess both high temporal and spatial resolutions. Therefore, we proposed to construct the EEG large-scale cortical dFNC based on brain atlas to probe the subtle dynamic activities in the brain and developed a novel method, that is, wavelet coherence–S estimator (WTCS), to assess the dynamic couplings among functional subnetworks with different spatial dimensions. The simulation study demonstrated its robustness and availability of applying to dFNC. The application in real EEG data revealed the appealing “Primary peak” and “P3-like peak” in dFNC network properties and meaningful evolutions in dFNC network topology for P300. Our study brings new insights for probing brain activities at a more dynamical and higher hierarchical level and pushing forward the development of brain-inspired artificial neural networks.

The feature maps were concatenated and used as input to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for ADHD classification. To show the efficacy of the recommended approach, EEG data from 15 ADHD individuals and 18 control subjects (CS) were analyzed. The results showed that concatenated EEGFMs were successful to classify ADHD with up to 99.72% accuracy.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9360-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO58844.2023.10289787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10289787","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD);EEG;Feature Map;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Complexity theory","","2","","17","","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many signal processing algorithms involving preprocessing, feature extraction/selection, and classification have been deployed and yet, the most appropriate and robust solutions are still being sought. This paper presents an analysis of a new methodology for feature extraction in a BCI which is based on identifying the extent of ultrametricity from EEG time-series. This work is inspired by the idea that there are natural, not necessarily unique, tree or hierarchy structures defined by the ultrametric topology of EEG time-series. The objective is to determine if coefficients which reflect the extent of ultrametricity can be used as distinct features of different EEG time series, recorded whilst subjects imagine left/right hand movements (motor imagery(MI)). The results show that MI based EEG time-series can be separated using a local ultrametricity quantifier and a linear discriminant classifier or Bayes classifier. Also, it is shown that neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) produces a higher dimensional space in which local ultrametricity is more separable for two classes of EEG signals.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352387","","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain computer interfaces;Extraterrestrial measurements;Time series analysis;Robustness;Signal processing;Speech;Handicapped aids;Communication standards","Adult;Automatic Data Processing;Brain;Electroencephalography;Female;Hand;Humans;Male;Movement;User-Computer Interface","1","","12","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In ten normal subjects (five male), aged 29-54 years, EEG activity was recorded from four channels during cognitive tasks grouped in pairs, and performed alternately. Four imagery tasks were: spatial navigation around a familiar environment; auditory imagery of a familiar tune; and right and left motor imagery of opening and closing the hand.

The highest communication rate was found using the navigation and auditory imagery tasks. In terms of classification performance and, hence, possible communication rate, these results were significantly better (p<0.05) than those obtained with the classical pairing of motor tasks involving imaginary movements of the left and right hands. In terms of EEG data analysis, a nonlinear classification model provided more robust results than a linear model (p/spl Lt/0.01), and a lower AR model order than those used in previous work was found to be effective. These findings have implications for establishing appropriate methods to operate BCI systems, particularly for disabled people who may experience difficulty with motor tasks, even motor imagery.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.821372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273522","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Signal processing;Navigation;Brain computer interfaces;Aging;Logistics;Signal generators;Data analysis;Robustness","Adult;Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Cognition;Communication;Communication Aids for Disabled;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Pilot Projects;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","87","","27","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, attention has been given to the CatBoost, ResNet34D, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB2 models. The proposed approach utilized a vast EEG dataset with 11,000 samples of spectrograms, and it conducted an in-depth comparison of these models. Data preprocessing included features developed with statistical measures and the formation of uniform EEG spectrograms. All these models were evaluated in terms of their KL divergence score, defined as a measure of the divergence between the predicted and target distributions. From all the models considered, CatBoost proved to be one with an excellent performance, having had a KL score value at 0.78 compared to that of deep learning models. This work demonstrates the potential of gradient boosting for EEG-activity classification tasks and can be of benefit as a source of insight for interested applications in real-time brain activity monitoring and diagnostics of neurological issues.","","979-8-3315-1894-3","10.1109/InCoWoCo64194.2024.10863372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10863372","EEG Signal Classification;CatBoost;Deep Learning;ResNet34D;EfficientNet;Kullback-Leibler Divergence;Brain Activity Detection;Feature Engineering","Deep learning;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Pattern classification;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Computational efficiency;Spectrogram;Long short term memory","","","","18","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This hypothesis is appealing from computer science perspective because neural networks at criticality exhibit optimal processing and computing properties while having implications in clinical applications to neurological disorders. In this paper, we introduced brain criticality analysis to track neurodevelopment from childhood to adolescence using the electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 662 subjects aged 5 to 16 years from the Child Mind Institute. We computed brain criticality from long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). We also compared the brain criticality analysis with standard EEG power analysis. The results showed a statistically significant increase in brain criticality from childhood to adolescence in the alpha band. A decreasing trend was observed in theta band from EEG power analysis, but a much higher variance was observed compared to the brain criticality analysis. However, the significant results were only observed in some EEG channels, and not observed if the analysis were performed separately with eyes-open and eyes-close condition. Nonetheless, the results suggest that brain criticality may serve as a biomarker of brain development and maturation, but further research is needed to improve brain criticality algorithms and EEG analysis methods.Clinical Relevance— The brain criticality analysis may be used to characterize and predict neurodevelopment in early childhood.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340775","Institute for Infocomm Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340775","","Neurological diseases;Brain;Time series analysis;Aging;Market research;Prediction algorithms;Electroencephalography","Child;Humans;Child, Preschool;Adolescent;Brain;Electroencephalography;Neural Networks, Computer;Eye","","","22","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the limited capabilities of conventional brain signal processing is restricting a wider application of BCIs.

Moreover, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a very well-known algorithm for its efficiency, but it just can extract the spatial information of the brain signals. To address these issues, we introduce the RMCSP method that exploits data in spectral, temporal and spatial domains in order to increase the classification accuracy in BCI. In addition, RMCSP is designed to handle EEG with small number of channels. To verify the efficacy of our approach, we rigorously tested the performances of the method in 17 subjects, from BCI competition datasets, in both two-class and four-class problems.

The detection of epileptic seizures and signal artefacts are two key examples. Epoch-based classification is the typical machine learning framework to detect such signal events because of the straightforward application of classical machine learning techniques. Usually, post-processing is required to achieve good performance and enforce temporal dependencies. Designing the right post-processing scheme to convert these classification outputs into events is a tedious, and labor-intensive element of this framework. Methods: We propose an event-based modeling framework that directly works with events as learning targets, stepping away from ad-hoc post-processing schemes to turn model outputs into events. We illustrate the practical power of this framework on simulated data and real-world data, comparing it to epoch-based modeling approaches. Results: We show that event-based modeling (without tailored post-processing) performs on par with or better than epoch-based modeling with extensive post-processing. Conclusion: These results show the power of treating events as direct learning targets, instead of using ad-hoc post-processing to obtain them, severely reducing design effort. Significance The event-based modeling framework can easily be applied to other event detection problems in signal processing, removing the need for intensive task-specific post-processing.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2024.3375759","European Research Council(grant numbers:802895); Vlaamse regering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465660","Biomedical signal processing;deep learning;neural networks","Predictive models;Training;Signal processing;Biomedical communication;Object detection;Biomedical signal processing;Deep learning;Neural networks","Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Algorithms;Epilepsy;Seizures;Artifacts","2","","34","IEEE","11 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, thought pattern based control using EEG signals is difficult due two main reasons; 1) EEG signals are highly noisy and contain many outliers, 2) EEG signals are high dimensional. Therefore the contribution of this paper is a novel methodology for recognizing thought patterns based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The presented thought recognition methodology is a three step process which utilizes SOM for unsupervised clustering of pre-processed EEG data and feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification.

In this work, we present a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) linear state-space model (LSSM) to describe the brain network dynamics in response to electrical stimulation. The LSSM maps the parameters of electrical stimulation, such as frequency, amplitude and pulse-width to recorded brain signals such as electrocorticography (ECoG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Effective identification of the LSSM in open-loop stimulation experiments, however, is strongly dependent on the open-loop input stimulation design. We propose a novel input design to accurately identify the LSSM by integrating the concept of binary noise (BN) with practical constraints on stimulation waveforms. The designed input pattern is a pulse train modulated by stochastic BN parameters. We show that this input pattern both satisfies the necessary spectral condition for accurate system identification and can incorporate any desired pulse shape. Using numerical experiments, we show that the quality of identification depends heavily on the input signal pattern and the proposed binary noise modulated pattern achieves satisfactory identification results, reducing the relative estimation error more than 300 times compared with step sequence modulated, single-sinusoid modulated and multi-sinusoids modulated input patterns.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318799","","Brain models;Estimation error;Electrical stimulation;Frequency modulation;MIMO","Artifacts;Brain;Electric Stimulation;Humans;Nerve Net;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors","5","","19","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work a method of spatial filtering which combines DOA estimation and Beamforming techniques is presented: a DOA estimation method allows to estimate the directions of activation of the sources, while spatial filters of type Beamforming are designed to pass the electrical activity from a given direction and stop that originated from other directions.

Results illustrated that real words can activate speech perception brain network rapidly, then finished very soon. When perceiving pseudowords, the onset of the perception brain network was slower, but activity lasted longer.

To investigate both immediate effects and short-term effects of cTBS on dynamic brain changes, cTBS was applied to 22 healthy participants over their left motor cortex. We recorded eyes-open, resting-state EEG and performance in the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) before cTBS, immediately after cTBS, and 80 minutes after cTBS. We identified nine states using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach to describe the process of dynamic brain changes. The spatial activation, temporal profiles of HMM states and behavioral performance of NHPT were assessed and compared. cTBS altered the temporal profiles of S1-S5 immediately after cTBS and the temporal profiles of S5, S6 and S7 80 min after cTBS. Moreover, cTBS improved motor function of the left hand. State 1 was characterized as the activation of right occipito-temporal area, and NHPT behavioral performance of the left hand positively correlated with the occurrence of state 1, and negatively correlated with the interval time of state 1 after cTBS. The transitions between S1 or S7 and other states showed dynamic reconfiguration during after-effect sustained time after cTBS.

However, in real applications, traditional Granger causality is prone to the influence of outliers, such as inevitable ocular artifacts, resulting in unreasonable brain linkages and the failure to decipher inherent cognition states. In this work, motivated by constructing the sparse causality brain networks under the strong physiological outlier noise conditions, we proposed a dual Laplacian Granger causality analysis (DLap-GCA) by imposing Laplacian distributions on both model parameters and residuals. In essence, the first Laplacian assumption on residuals will resist the influence of outliers in electroencephalogram (EEG) on causality inference, and the second Laplacian assumption on model parameters will sparsely characterize the intrinsic interactions among multiple brain regions. Through simulation study, we quantitatively verified its effectiveness in suppressing the influence of complex outliers, the stable capacity for model estimation, and sparse network inference. The application to motor-imagery (MI) EEG further reveals that our method can effectively capture the inherent hemispheric lateralization of MI tasks with sparse patterns even under strong noise conditions. The MI classification based on the network features derived from the proposed approach shows higher accuracy than other existing traditional approaches, which is attributed to the discriminative network structures being captured in a timely manner by DLap-GCA even under the single-trial online condition. Basically, these results consistently show its robustness to the influence of complex outliers and the capability of characterizing representative brain networks for cognition information processing, which has the potential to offer reliable network structures for both cognitive studies and future brain–computer interface (BCI) realization.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3292179","STI 2030-Major Projects(grant numbers:2022ZD0211400,2022ZD0208500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:#61901077,#62171074,#U19A2082,#61961160705); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1171); Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN202200640); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185974","Bayesian;electroencephalograms (EEGs);Granger causality;Laplacian distribution;motor-imagery (MI) brain–computer interface (BCI)","Laplace equations;Brain modeling;Estimation;Electroencephalography;Time series analysis;Robustness;Bayes methods","Humans;Electroencephalography;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Brain;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Imagination;Computer Simulation;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Nerve Net","8","","61","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research proposed Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) to identifying post-stroke EEG signals. EEG signals for each channel are passed Wavelet to filter in 1-13 Hz. This frequency band contains low waves such as Delta, Theta, and Alpha often observed in post-stroke patients. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have extracted multi-channel signals before being identified using Recurrent Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdaDelta were used for making result corrections in the identified stage.

In order to facilitate clinical diagnosis and/or implement so-called brain computer interface (BCI), detecting the rhythmic activity from EEG data recorded in a noisy environment is crucial; however, classical signal processing techniques like linear filtering or the Fourier transform cannot detect such a rhythmic signal if the power of noise is so large. This paper presents a simple but practical method for extracting a rhythmic signal by fully exploiting the multi-variate nature of EEG data. The rhythmic component of interest is estimated as the weighted sum of multi-channel signals, and the optimal weights are then derived so as to maximize the power of the component. After the derivation is illustrated, adaptive weights, which give a new time-frequency analysis, are introduced. Moreover, the application to recently developed empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is presented. Experimental results on real EEG data support the analysis.","2379-190X","978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517637","Electroencephalogram (EEG);signal extraction;brain computer interface;multi-channel signal processing","Data mining;Electroencephalography;Data analysis;Working environment noise;Signal processing;Clinical diagnosis;Brain computer interfaces;Maximum likelihood detection;Fourier transforms;Time frequency analysis","","10","","7","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These are well-known nonparametric FEPs but their simplicity prevents them from matching the performance of more complex FEPs. Neural time-series prediction preprocessing (NTSPP) has been shown to enhance the separability of both time- and frequency-based features and is used in this work to improve the applicability of these FEPs. NTSPP uses a number of prediction modules (PMs) to perform m-step ahead prediction of EEG time-series recorded whilst subjects perform motor imagery-based mental tasks. Depending on the PMs, the NTSPP framework normally requires subject-specific parameters to be predefined. In this work each PM is a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN). The SOFNN has a self-organizing structure and good nonlinear approximation capabilities however; a number of parameters must be defined prior to training. This is problematic therefore the practicality of a general set of parameters, previously selected via a sensitivity analysis (SA), is analyzed.

Here, QR decomposition based recursive least squares (QR-RLS) algorithm with forgetting factor is derived for AAR parameter estimation and realized to track the EEG features with numerical stability. EEG features from motor imagery datasets are extracted by the proposed method and classified with Linear Discriminate Analysis. For further validation, a comparative analysis is obtained between the presented methodology and already existing EEG processing methods, i.e., Least Mean Squares, RLS and conventional QR-RLS.

In order to maximally utilize the information contained in simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording, many sophisticated multimodal data-mining methods, such as joint ICA, have been developed. However, these methods normally deal with data recorded in one experimental condition, and they cannot effectively extract information on activities that are distinct in two conditions. In this paper, a new data decomposition method called joint common spatial pattern (jCSP) is proposed. Compared with previous methods, the jCSP method exploits inter-conditional difference in the strength of brain source activities to achieve source separation, and is able to uncover the source activities with the strongest discriminative power. A group analysis based on clustering is further proposed to reveal distinctive jCSP patterns at group level. We applied joint CSP to a simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset collected from 21 subjects under two different resting-state conditions (eyes-closed and eyes-open).

Several features are proposed to characterize the resultant state sequence to provide a single measure for a complete hour-long EEG recording. These features aim at capturing both the statistics of the state durations (e.g. average state duration, average number of segments), and any patterns contained in the sequentiality of the obtained states (e.g. permutation entropy, entropy rate).

It is the combination of such neuronal oscillators that results into different spontaneous cognitive activities of the brain. Thus finding the locations of such neuronal sources in the cortex is important and can be performed using source localization techniques. The source identification was performed on band-passed (0-35 Hz and 35Hz to 80 Hz) EEG data for both the pre-BP and BP conditions.

The neurophysiological link between signals from fMRI and EEG is isolated due to varieties of reasons; however, here we propose a novel signal processing approach to decode the time-course of functional connectivity obtained from fMRI by the concurrently recorded EEG signals (n = 28). To exploit the feasibility of this fusion network decoding, we present a novel machine learning method, ""optimized forward variable selection decoder,"" that achieves higher decoding accuracy over classical methods.

The analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings provides valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. An epileptic seizure is usually identified by polyspike activity; rhythmic waves for a wide variety of frequencies and amplitudes as well as spike-and-wave complexes. The detection of all these waveforms in the EEG is a crucial component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-frequency analysis is particularly effective for representing various aspects of nonstationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. In this paper a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using time-frequency analysis, and classification using artificial neural network, is introduced. EEG segments are analyzed using a time-frequency distribution and then, several features are extracted for each segment representing the energy distribution over the time-frequency plane. The features are used for the training of a neural network. Short-time Fourier transform and several time-frequency distributions are compared. The proposed approach is tested using a publicly available database and satisfactory results are obtained (89-100% accuracy).","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352208","","Time frequency analysis;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Signal processing;Artificial neural networks;Signal analysis;Feature extraction;Biological neural networks;Fourier transforms;Testing","Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Statistical Distributions;Time Factors","38","","21","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recordings of the electrical activity of brain, which are used extensively in many medical applications, including detection of epileptic seizures. Traditionally, neurologists made inferences by visual inspection. However, this was usually very time consuming and the results are subject to the expertise of the reader. Hence, automatic epileptic seizure detection techniques are needed, which are able to provide high quality results in a short time. In this paper, an approach has been proposed that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform to convert the EEG signal into the time-frequency domain. Approximation and detail coefficients were obtained after the discrete wavelet transform of EEG signals. Then, various features are extracted and then classification is carried out on a number of classifiers including convolutional neural networks, random forests etc for the detection of epilepsy seizure. Results show that our processing technique and the combination of features extracted provide far superior results than those obtained by applying the classifiers on the EEG signals directly. In our work, an accuracy of 99.29 was achieved which outperformed the conventional epileptic seizure detection techniques.

Such AAD methods are believed to be an important ingredient towards so-called neuro-steered assistive hearing devices. For example, traditional AAD decoders allow detecting to which of multiple speakers a listener is attending to by reconstructing the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal from the EEG signals. Recently, an alternative paradigm to this stimulus reconstruction approach was proposed, in which the directional focus of auditory attention is determined instead, solely based on the EEG, using common spatial pattern filters (CSP). Here, we propose Riemannian geometry-based classification (RGC) as an alternative for this CSP approach, in which the covariance matrix of a new EEG segment is directly classified while taking its Riemannian structure into account. While the proposed RGC method performs similarly to the CSP method for short decision lengths (i.e., the amount of EEG samples used to make a decision), we show that it significantly outperforms it for longer decision window lengths.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413404","KU Leuven; European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9413404","neuro-steered hearing device;auditory attention decoding;directional focus of attention;brain-computer interface;Riemannian geometry;electroencephalography","Conferences;Neural activity;Signal processing algorithms;Auditory system;Signal processing;Electroencephalography;Acoustics","","14","","14","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper illustrates how neural networks are employed in a prediction based preprocessing framework, referred to as neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP), in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). NTSPP has been shown to increase feature separability by mapping the original EEG signals via time-series-prediction to a higher dimensional space. Preliminary results of a similar novel framework are also presented where, instead of using predictive NNs, auto-associative NNs are employed and features are extracted from the output of auto-associative NNs trained to specialize on EEG signals for particular brain states. The results show that this preprocessing framework referred to as auto-associative NN preprocessing (ANNP) also has the potential to improve the performance of BCIs. Both the NTSPP and ANNP are compared with and deployed in conjunction with the well know common spatial patterns (CSP) to produce a BCI system which significantly outperforms either approach operating independently and has the potential to produce good performances even with a lower number of EEG channels compared to a multichannel BCI. Multichannel BCIs normally perform better that 2-3 channel BCIs however reducing the number of EEG channels required can positively impact on the time needed to mount electrodes and minimize the obtrusiveness of the electrode montage for the user. It is also shown that NTSPP can improve the potential for employing existing BCI methods with minimal subject-specific parameter tuning to deploy the BCI autonomously.

The proposed framework constructs optimized subject-specific spectral filters in an intuitive fashion resulting in creation of significantly discriminant features, which is a crucial requirement for any EEG-based BCI system. Through incorporation of the ECOC approach, the classification problem is then modeled as communication over a noisy channel where the misclassification error is corrected by error correction techniques borrowed from an information theory. This paper also proposes a modified version of the ECOC adopted to EEG classification problems by deploying ternary class codewords to increase the Hamming distance between the codewords and introduce more robustness to misclassification error.

Deep learning methods have been increasingly adopted for ERP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to their excellent feature representation abilities, which allow for deep analysis of oscillatory activity within the brain. Features with higher spatiotemporal frequencies usually represent detailed and localized information, while features with lower spatiotemporal frequencies usually represent global structures. Mining EEG features from multiple spatiotemporal frequencies is conducive to obtaining more discriminative information. A multiscale feature fusion octave convolution neural network (MOCNN) is proposed in this article. MOCNN divides the ERP signals into high-, medium- and low-frequency components corresponding to different resolutions and processes them in different branches. By adding mid- and low-frequency components, the feature information used by MOCNN can be enriched, and the required amount of calculations can be reduced. After successive feature mapping using temporal and spatial convolutions, MOCNN realizes interactive learning among different components through the exchange of feature information among branches. Classification is accomplished by feeding the fused deep spatiotemporal features from various components into a fully connected layer. The results, obtained on two public datasets and a self-collected ERP dataset, show that MOCNN can achieve state-of-the-art ERP classification performance. In this study, the generalized concept of octave convolution is introduced into the field of ERP-BCI research, which allows effective spatiotemporal features to be extracted from multiscale networks through branch width optimization and information interaction at various scales.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2024.3390805","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176090); STI 2030-Major Projects under(grant numbers:2022ZD0208900); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2021SHZDZX); Project of Jiangsu Province Science and Technology Plan Special Fund in 2022 (Key Research and Development Plan Industry Foresight, Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (JKH01231636), and Key Core Technologies)(grant numbers:BE2022064-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521896","Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs);deep learning;event-related potentials (ERPs);multiscale;octave convolution (OctConv) neural network","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Convolutional neural networks;Brain-computer interfaces;Deep learning","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Humans;Electroencephalography;Neural Networks, Computer;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Evoked Potentials;Deep Learning;Brain;Algorithms","15","","53","IEEE","7 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding the vulnerabilities of EEG analytics is important for safely applying this emerging technology in our daily life. Recent studies show that EEG analytics are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when adding small perturbations on the EEG data. However, fewer research efforts have been devoted to the robustness of EEG analytics under sparse perturbations that attack only small portions of the data. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth study on the robustness of EEG analytics under sparse perturbations and propose the first Sparse Adversarial eeG Attack, SAGA, to identify weakness of EEG analytics. Specifically, by viewing EEG data as time series collected from several channels, we design an adaptive mask to uniformly represent diverse sparsity in adversarial attacks. We further introduce a PGD-based iterative solver to automatically select the time steps and channels under the given sparsity constraints and effectively identify the adversarial examples on EEG data. Extensive experiments show that SAGA can effectively generate sparse perturbations and introduces a 77.02% accuracy drop on average by only perturbing 5% channels and time steps.","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9413507","","Adaptation models;Perturbation methods;Conferences;Time series analysis;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","10","","25","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such instability is dangerous for EEG-based BCI applications because signals in practice are different from training data. In this study, we propose a multi-scale activity transition network (MSATNet) to alleviate the influence of the translation problem in convolution-based models. MSATNet provides an activity state pyramid consisting of multi-scale recurrent neural networks to capture the relationship between brain activities, which is a translation-invariant feature.

Because of this disadvantage, it is difficult to ensure adequate reliability compared to their high performance. In this study, we propose an explainable deep learning model aimed at classifying EEG signal which is obtained from the motor-imagery (MI) task. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) was adopted on the model to interpret the reason that the model derived certain classification output. We visualized the heatmap which indicates the output of the LRP in the form of topography to certify neuro-physiological factors. Furthermore, we classified EEG in the subject-independent manner to learn robust and generalized EEG features by avoiding subject dependency. The methodology also provides the advantage of avoiding the expense of building training data for each subject. With our proposed model, we obtained generalized heatmap patterns for all subjects.

But the general fear regarding the fusion between MEG and EEG data is that the drawbacks from one modality will systematically spoil the performances of the other one without any consequent improvement. This is the case for instance for the estimation of deeper or radial sources with MEG. In this paper, the authors propose a method for a cooperative processing of MEG and EEG in a distributed source model. First, the evaluation of the respective performances of each modality for the estimation of every dipole in the source pattern is made using a conditional entropy criterion. Then, the algorithm operates a preprocessing of the MEG and EEG gain matrices which minimizes the mutual information between these two transfer functions, by a selective weighting of the MEG and EEG lead fields.

Detecting and classifying ES is essential for proper medical intervention and management. This study addresses ES detection using EEG analysis, focusing specifically on the context of Bangladesh. This study presents a EEG-based method for detecting epileptic seizures differentiating between seizure and non-seizure signals. Utilizing empirical mode decomposition, essential subcomponents are extracted from EEG signals, from which three distinct features were derived. Neural Network (NN), the well-known machine learning model, is employed for ES classification from the extracted features. The significance of this research lies in the utilization of real-life EEG data from a hospital in Khulna, Bangladesh, rather than relying solely on publicly available benchmark datasets. Processing real-life EEG data presents unique challenges, including data preprocessing and variability in EEG signals due to different devices and channel configurations. The proposed model achieved remarkable average accuracies, with 91.05% using 50 hidden neurons in the NN. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outcomes were also compared with publicly available benchmark dataset. The proposed method offers a reliable and efficient approach for ES detection, particularly relevant for real-life healthcare settings in Bangladesh, contributing to improved epilepsy management.","","979-8-3503-7083-6","10.1109/EICT61409.2023.10427701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10427701","Epilepsy;Seizure;EEG;Empirical Mode Decomposition;Neural Network","Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Reliability","","1","","13","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, which can be used to decode user intentions. Because the feature space of EEG data is highly dimensional and signal patterns are specific to the subject, appropriate methods for feature representation are required to enhance the decoding accuracy of the CNN model. Furthermore, neural changes exhibit high variability between sessions, subjects within a single session, and trials within a single subject, resulting in major issues during the modeling stage. In addition, there are many subject-dependent factors, such as frequency ranges, time intervals, and spatial locations at which the signal occurs, which prevent the derivation of a robust model that can achieve the parameterization of these factors for a wide range of subjects. However, previous studies did not attempt to preserve the multivariate structure and dependencies of the feature space. In this study, we propose a method to generate a spatiospectral feature representation that can preserve the multivariate information of EEG data. Specifically, 3-D feature maps were constructed by combining subject-optimized and subject-independent spectral filters and by stacking the filtered data into tensors. In addition, a layer-wise decomposition model was implemented using our 3-D-CNN framework to secure reliable classification results on a single-trial basis. The average accuracies of the proposed model were 87.15% (±7.31), 75.85% (±12.80), and 70.37% (±17.09) for the BCI competition data sets IV_2a, IV_2b, and OpenBMI data, respectively. These results are better than those obtained by state-of-the-art techniques, and the decomposition model obtained the relevance scores for neurophysiologically plausible electrode channels and frequency domains, confirming the validity of the proposed approach.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3048385","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) Grant, funded through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2015-0-00185); Development of Intelligent Pattern Recognition Softwares for Ambulatory Brain Computer Interface(grant numbers:2017-0-00451); Development of BCI based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions using Deep Learning(grant numbers:2019-0-00079); Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program, Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325918","Brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);electroencephalography (EEG);explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);motor imagery (MI)","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Mutual information;Decoding;Feature extraction;Probability;Entropy","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Neuroimaging","99","","48","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prediction of fatigue degrees is a crucial and arduous biomedical issue for driving safety, which has attracted growing attention of the research community in the recent past. Meanwhile, combined with the benefits of measuring EEG signals facilitates, many EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed for use in real-time mental assessment. In the literature, EEG signals are severely blended with stochastic noise; therefore, the performance of BCIs is constrained by low resolution in recognition tasks. For this rationale, independent component analysis (ICA) is usually used to find a source mapping from original data that has been blended with unrelated artificial noise. However, the mechanism of ICA cannot be used in real-time BCI design. To overcome this bottleneck, the proposed system in this paper utilizes a recurrent self-evolving fuzzy neural work (RSEFNN) to increase memory capability for adaptive noise cancellation when assessing drivers' mental states during a car driving task. The experimental results without the use of ICA procedure indicate that the proposed RSEFNN model remains superior performance compared with the state-of-the-arts models.","","978-1-5090-0626-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7738006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738006","Electroencephalography (EEG);recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN);brain-computer interface (BCI);driving safety;fatigue prediction","Electroencephalography;Fatigue;Real-time systems;Vehicles;Fuzzy neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Integrated circuits","","14","","17","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In view of this, this paper innovatively proposes an efficient real-time data processing architecture based on deep learning technology, the core of which is an advanced model based on variational autoencoder (VAE). The uniqueness of this model is that it can cleverly handle the inherent nonlinear and high-dimensional characteristics of EEG signals, thereby significantly improving the decoding accuracy and data processing efficiency of the signal. The algorithm in this paper cleverly combines deep neural networks to optimize the signal extraction process and feature selection strategy. The performance of the proposed model is comprehensively evaluated through carefully designed simulation experiments. The experimental results convincingly prove that this model greatly improves the decoding accuracy of brain-computer interface signals while ensuring the processing speed. Specifically, data analysis shows that compared with traditional methods, this model performs well in average classification accuracy, data processing speed and anti-interference ability, achieving significant transcendence.

As a result, EEG denoising is an inevitable step in EEG signal processing applications. This paper focuses on electrooculogram (EOG) signal cancellation from EEG signals. EOG signals are low-frequency signals that occur in the frequency range of 0-10Hz. Wavelet Thresholding is one of the efficient denoising methods for signals like EEG. Here, Wavelet Thresholding is used to eliminate EOG signals from the artifacted EEG signals. Generally, the threshold value for wavelet denoising is determined arbitrarily and the same for every level of decomposition. Therefore, most of the time, the elimination of artifacts is not accomplished effectively. In this methodology, the threshold value is calculated separately for each level of decomposition.

The powers at these dominant frequencies are analyzed to reveal the state of brain injury during an experimental study involving progressive hypoxia, asphyxia, and recovery. Neonatal piglets (n=8) were exposed to a sequence of 30 min of hypoxia (10% oxygen), 5 min of room air, and 7 min of asphyxia. They then received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and were subsequently monitored for 4 h. An optimal AR model order of 6 was obtained for these data, resulting in 3 dominant frequencies. These dominant frequencies, referred to as the low, medium, and high frequency components, fell in the bands 1.0-5.5 Hz, 9.0-14.0 Hz, and 18.0-21.0 Hz, respectively. A remarkable feature of the authors' data is the spectral dispersion, or diverging trends in the 3 frequency bands. During hypoxia, the relative powers of the medium and high-frequency components of EEG increased up to 160% and 176%, from their respective baseline values. During the first minute of asphyxia the medium- and high-frequency powers (relative to baseline) increased by 280-400%. The power in all 3 frequency components went down to nearly zero within 40-80 s of asphyxia. During recovery, the phenomenon of burst-suppression was clearly exhibited in the low-frequency component. A new index, called mean normalized separation, representing the degree of disproportionality in the recovery of powers of the 3 dominant components relative to their mean recovered power, is presented as a possible single indicator of electrical function recovery.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown significant promise in detecting MCI due to their affordability, real-time monitoring capabilities, and noninvasiveness. EEG provides continuous brain activity data, while ERPs offer insights into specific cognitive processes by analyzing brain responses to stimuli. These methods can complement each other in MCI diagnosis by providing a comprehensive view of overall brain function and detailed information on specific cognitive processes. However, EEG and ERP are susceptible to noise and interindividual variability, which can hinder their reliability. In addition, applying machine learning models on EEG or ERP for MCI detection presents challenges such as the risk of overfitting and difficulties in interpreting the underlying decision-making process. This review emphasizes recent advancements in signal processing and feature extraction methods applied to EEG and ERP data and explores the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and interpretative depth. By integrating these methodologies, the review highlights how EEG and ERP can contribute to a more effective understanding and monitoring of cognitive changes associated with MCI, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis for timely intervention and improved patient care. Finally, the review focuses on future research directions, including the development of advanced analytical techniques and multimodal integration approaches involving EEG and ERP to further improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical application.","2836-2071","","10.1109/JSAS.2025.3552546","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:111-2221-E-A49-200-MY2,112-2321-B-037-005); Evelyn F.

This approach assumes that behavioral errors of participants are in line with the neural processing. However, this may not be the case, in particular in experiments with time pressure or studies investigating the threshold of perception. In these cases, the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the heteroscedastic nature of the underlying experimental set-up. This problem of systematic and structured (non-uniform) label noise is ignored when analysis are based on behavioral data, as is being done typically. Thus, we run the risk to arrive at wrong conclusions in our analysis.

An electroencephalogram is a specialized diagnostic tool for monitoring brain activity electrically. Human brain anomalies and responses to stimuli can be deduced from EEG recordings. The presence of extraneous signals, known as artefacts, can cause distortion in EEG recordings. Since these aberrations introduce spikes that can be mistaken for neurological rhythms and since the properties of practically all biomedical signals vary with time, it is challenging to evaluate the EEG. Therefore, in order to guarantee an accurate analysis and diagnosis, noise and unwanted signals must be removed from the EEG. The identification of artefacts, or any potential deviation that has a source other than the brain, is a critical issue in this field. Artifacts can originate from a variety of sources, including the undesired movement of the eyes and eyelids, breathing, bodily movements, power line interference, muscular, cardiac activity, etc. The computational complexity is the primary subject of extensive research into adaptive filtering algorithms. The goal is to create a variety of novel ANC's for denoising EEG signals while taking into account computing complexity, Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Mis-adjustment, and convergence difficulties. This is done by taking into account three types of adaptive algorithms: The Least Mean Square (LMS) Adaptive algorithm and its several weight update variations.","","979-8-3503-4595-7","10.1109/IHCSP56702.2023.10127136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127136","EEG;LMS;ANC;Accuracy","Technological innovation;Heart beat;Scalp;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptive algorithms;Electroencephalography;Recording","","2","","17","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique was applied in EEG signals of 7 subjects performing 5 mental tasks. For each mode obtained from the EMD and each EEG channel were computed six features: Root Mean Square (RMS), Variance, Shannon Entropy, Lempel-Ziv Complexity Value, and Central and Maximum Frequencies, obtaining a feature vector of 180 components. The Wilks' lambda parameter was applied for the selection of the most important variables reducing the dimensionality of the feature vector.

To do this in real-time, with low computational overhead, on a mobile platform in a channel count independent manner to enable portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Methods: We propose a Deep AutoEncoder (DAE) neural network for single-channel EEG artifact removal, and implement it on a smartphone via TensorFlow Lite. Delegate based acceleration is employed to allow real-time, low computational resource operation. Artifact removal performance is quantified by comparing corrupted and ground-truth clean EEG data from public datasets for a range of artifact types. The on-phone computational resources required are also measured when processing pre-saved data. Results: DAE cleaned EEG shows high correlations with ground-truth clean EEG, with average Correlation Coefficients of 0.96, 0.85, 0.70 and 0.79 for clean EEG reconstruction, and EOG, motion, and EMG artifact removal respectively. On-smartphone tests show the model processes a 4 s EEG window within 5 ms, substantially outperforming a comparison FastICA artifact removal algorithm. Conclusion: The proposed DAE model shows effectiveness in single-channel EEG artifact removal. This is the first demonstration of a low-computational resource deep learning model for mobile EEG in smartphones with hardware/software acceleration. Significance: This work enables portable BCIs which require low latency real-time artifact removal, and potentially operation with a small number of EEG channels for wearability.

Therefore, graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit weak robustness and overfitting problems when identifying brain networks. Furthermore, existing studies have predominantly focused on strongly coupled connections, neglecting substantial evidence from other intricate systems that highlight the value of weakly coupled connections. Consequently, the potential of weakly coupled brain networks remains untapped. In this study, we pioneeringly construct weakly coupled brain networks and validate their values in emotion identification tasks. Subsequently, we propose a sparse adaptive gated GNN (SAGN) that can simultaneously perceive the valuable topology of dual-view (i.e., strongly coupled and weakly coupled) brain networks. The SAGN contains a sparse adaptive global receptive field. Moreover, SAGN employs a gated mechanism with feature enhancement and adaptive noise suppression capabilities. To address the lack of inductive bias and the large capacity of SAGN, a graph regularization term built with prior topology of dual-view brain networks is introduced to enhance generalization. Besides a public dataset (SEED), we also built a custom dataset (MuSer) with 60 subjects to evaluate weakly coupled brain networks’ value and validate the SAGN’s performance. Experiments demonstrate that brain physiological patterns associated with different emotional states are separable and rooted in weakly coupled brain networks.

Such a method allows us to extract source signals with specific stochastic properties, e.g., extraction of narrow band sources with specific frequency bandwidth.","","0-7803-7616-1","10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030063","","Frequency;Data mining;Independent component analysis;Biosensors;Signal analysis;Electroencephalography;Band pass filters;Stochastic resonance;Narrowband;Bandwidth","","13","","17","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since it is very hard to fake an EEG signature or to attack an EEG biometric system, this paper presented a biometric security system that based on EEG signal processing. A new investigated method for person identification using the EEG Brain Signal processing is introduced. The proposed method based on executing a voting scheme between the 3 feature extraction methods which achieved maximum classification rates in the preliminary test. Preliminary test used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) for features extraction with two different measures with each of them, thus a total of 4 different methods, produced 4 different features sets. Classification rates were 93%, 87% & 93% using the 3 recommended features sets. After executing the proposed voting scheme, classification rate increased to 100%, for 3 subjects' experiment which surpassed the results from the previous works in this application. Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network trained by a standard back propagation algorithm is used as a classifier. Taking into account of reducing distraction to subjects, 4 channels only were used in the experiment and the subject need only to sit with eyes closed and quiet, which free the physical requirements of users and the condition of applying environment.","","978-1-4673-0126-8","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141420","EEG Signal processing;Biometric Security;Person Identification;Pattern Recognition of Brain Signals","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Wavelet packets;Discrete Fourier transforms;Biological neural networks;Discrete wavelet transforms;Security","","33","","24","IEEE","30 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is usually achieved by looking at the pattern of brain activity across many trials while the subject is imagining the performance of an instructed action - the process known as motor imagery. Nevertheless, existing motor imagery classification algorithms do not always achieve good performances because of the noisy and non-stationary nature of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability. Thus, current EEG BCI takes a considerable upfront toll on patients, who have to submit to lengthy training sessions before even being able to use the BCI. In this study, we developed a data-efficient classifier for left/right hand motor imagery by combining in our pattern recognition both the oscillation frequency range and the scalp location. We achieve this by using a combination of Morlet wavelet and Common Spatial Pattern theory to deal with nonstationarity and noise.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2018.2841847","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91420302,61573142); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WH1516018,222201717006); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1421948,BCS-1551688); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:14.756.31.0001); Polish National Science Center(grant numbers:2016/20/W/N24/00354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8386437","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);sparse group spatial pattern;temporal constraint","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Optimization;Support vector machines;Brain modeling;Cybernetics","Algorithms;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Task Performance and Analysis","261","","72","IEEE","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, nonlinear mechanism is believed to exist in forming brain networks. In the present study, we investigated the performance of a nonlinear metric, i.e., phase coherence, in probing brain networks, as compared with a linear metric, i.e., power correlation. Specifically, individual IBNs were firstly obtained by a time-frequency independent component analysis (tfICA), and then the interaction among them were probed using either phase coherence (inter-component phase coherence, ICPC) or power correlation coefficient (PCC). We examined them using high-density resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data from a group of patients with a balance disorder who received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatments. The results indicated that the use of ICPC indicated more detections of significant connectivity crossing multiple brain regions in various frequency bands than PCC. Moreover, consistent treatment-related network changes, as compared with previous neuroimaging findings, in this brain disorder were more successfully detected with ICPC. Therefore, it is important to use nonlinear metric in characterizing interactions between different brain regions and IBNs.","1948-3554","978-1-5090-4603-4","10.1109/NER.2017.8008302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008302","","Integrated circuits;Electroencephalography;Correlation;Brain;Coherence;Synchronization","","","","27","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we attempt to reconstruct/estimate various parameters of hand movement trajectory from multi channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected by performing an experiment that involved centre-out right hand movement tasks in four different directions at two different speeds in random order.

Advancements in EEG technology allow for its implementation such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI), wherein the electronic signals gathered from the EEG are processed as commands to perform certain outputs. Analysis of electrical signals is mainly done through the use of artificial intelligence, where the results of different methods are compared to isolate the best method. These methods include the FastAI neural network, XGBoost, and the random forest model. From the results, the FastAI neural network was the most accurate, with 82% accuracy for simulated testing and an accuracy of 81% for real-time testing. As such, a system that utilizes FastAI neural network is a viable option in translating EEG signals into directional commands.","","978-1-6654-0167-8","10.1109/HNICEM54116.2021.9732044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732044","brain-computer interface;EEG;deep learning;convolutional neural network;machine learning","Wheelchairs;Humanoid robots;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Real-time systems;Information technology;Biological neural networks","","1","","20","IEEE","16 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep learning-based methods perform excellently, but still suffer from interpretability. Although methods such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM) can cope with the above problem, their coarse granularity cannot accurately reveal the mechanism to promote emotional intelligence. In this paper, fine-grained interpretability is proposed, called Concat-aided Grad-CAM. Specifically, the multi-level feature mapping before the fully connected layer is concatenated to obtain the gradients of the target concept so that the discriminant information can be directly located in the high-precision area. Unlike coarse-grained interpretability methods applied in EEG emotion recognition, it can accurately highlight the EEG channels related to emotion rather than an obscure area. In addition, a systematic brain functional network is proposed to reveal the relationship between those channels and to further improve emotion recognition performance. The channels with greater contributions are connected, and those connections are learned by dynamic graph convolutional networks, while the others are independent to eliminate interference. Experiments on four EEG emotion recognition datasets manifest that Concat-aided Grad-CAM can be interpreted by the fine-grained. In addition, it has been shown that the learned brain functional network can improve the performance of the baselines. Significantly, the experiment results achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple experiments.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2023.3288885","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076102,62222603,92267203); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:2020B1515020041); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2019ZT08X214); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160113","Brain functional network;dynamic graph convolutional networks;EEG emotion recognition;interpretability","Electroencephalography;Emotion recognition;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Heating systems;Physiology","","22","","62","IEEE","23 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EEG data were collected from various subjects during induced stress (Cognitive task English comprehension test) and listening to the music in the reflexology sessions. EEG signal comparisons across various activities reveal that stress or cognitive demands increase Beta wave activity while decreasing Alpha and Theta waves.

However, as EEG signals easily suffer from various artifacts, ERPs are often collapsed and hard to observe. There are several attempts at using multi-channel EEG signals to enhance EEG signals of interest and make ERPs more clearly observed. For example, a previous work has proposed a blind EEG signal separation method using a multi-channel Wiener filter designed with a probabilistic generative model of observed EEG signals. This method copes with the under-determination of EEG signal separation by assuming sparseness of each EEG component in the time-frequency domain. Although this method blindly separates EEG signals into individual EEG components using time-varying scaled spatial correlation matrices, target EEG components, such as P300 of ERP, are often known in advance in some applications. In this paper, inspired by this previous work, we propose a probabilistic EEG signal enhancement method using a multi-channel Wiener filter, newly incorporating prior information of the spatial correlation matrices related to the target EEG component in the probabilistic generative model to improve performance of EEG signal enhancement. An experimental evaluation for P300 enhancement shows that the proposed method significantly reduces artifacts.","2379-190X","978-1-4673-6997-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178449","EEG signal enhancement;ERP;Wiener filter;spatial correlation prior","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Correlation;Time-frequency analysis;Covariance matrices;Source separation;Probabilistic logic","","18","","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying ErrP from a single trial electroencephalogram (EEG) data can be used in taking corrective actions to fix the error or as a learning strategy in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems. The ErrP dataset recorded using EEG will contain both erroneous and correct actions. A classifier such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be trained to identify the erroneous versus correct action from a single trial EEG data. However, the classifier will have large number of parameters to be learned, and typically, the ErrP dataset is unbalanced with smaller number of erroneous trials. Therefore, the trained classifier may not generalize the data well. To classify the ErrP with better accuracy, an ANN architecture is proposed in this work. Learning the parameters of the ANN is carried out in two stages (Stage-1 and Stage-2) in the proposed method. The first stage of learning will have relatively large feature samples collected from several subjects. The first stage learning is aimed to capture the global characteristics of the ErrP. In the second stage, the pre-trained ANN classifier from the first stage is tuned for each subject. The ErrP dataset has two sessions dataset recorded from six subjects and the Stage-1 and Stage-2 training models are cross-validated. The overall classification accuracy achieved after cross-validation is 74.78 ± 3.43% and 86.03 ± 1.02% for erroneous and correct trials respectively. The improvement in the classification accuracy achieved is 12.67% and 15.51% for erroneous and correct trials respectively compared with the existing statistical classifier method.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We use a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping.

While automated techniques exist for EEG analysis, it is likely that additional information can be extracted from EEG signals through the use of new methods. In this paper, we propose a method that applies artificial neural networks approach for identification of the inactive brain region from EEG signals. Let us assume for a while that inert region. The method has three main steps. First, a large scale, complex EEG signals is simply normalized into a reasonable data. Second, characteristic feature from EEG signals, the normalized EEG data has no regular rule and is still so complex that neural network can not learn the characteristic feature from EEG. Hence we extract characteristic feature from EEG and use root mean square (RMS) processes in EEG data. Finally, neural network is supplied as the input value to these processes in EEG and learn these characteristic feature. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we perform simulations on location of inert region from EEG data, consists of training and test data. These EEG estimation tasks were created by using a set of calculated, artificial EEG signals based on a number of current dipoles. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has several attractive features. 1) The method can estimate the EEG feature of inert region and better generalization performance can be achieved than non preprocessing EEG. 2) The more larger inert region were, the more small estimation error become. 3) If the sampling point of EEG signals is large, the estimation error will grow smaller.","1947-1394","978-981-05-79","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4155887","","Electroencephalography;Data mining;Biological neural networks;Estimation error;Humans;Information analysis;Signal analysis;Artificial neural networks;Signal processing;Large-scale systems","","","","23","","7 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this assumption is shown to be possibly true for intracranial EEG with a scalp reference. However, this assumption may not be true for scalp sources with a scalp reference electrode. As such, this limits the application of our methods to the vast majority of scalp EEG with cephalic reference. In this paper, we conduct analysis for five reference electrode locations of one subject: left thumb, left arm, left shoulder, left chest and left back. Since these locations are far away from the head of the subject, the real reference signal from these locations should be independent from all the scalp sources. As such, the second method in [8] should be able to be applied to identify the reference signal well. Our simulation results demonstrate that the corrected EEG after removing the obtained reference signal involves much more brain neural activities for anyone of these five reference locations than the corrected EEG after removing the average reference (AR), and the dominated periodical ECG artifacts in original EEG are completely removed out. This fact actually provides a strong evidence to support the above assumption of independence. The results in this paper suggest that rather rod reference sites such as hand, shoulder, chest, back, etc., indeed turn out to be much better than commonly suggested.","2161-2927","978-988-15638-1-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6390634","EEG;Reference Signal;Independence;Average Reference","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Electrocardiography;Scalp;Muscles;Electric potential;Brain modeling","","","","11","","24 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the differences in monitoring methods in BCI systems, the focus of system operation may also change. In some BCI systems, it may be preferable to focus on Motor Imagery in another system, while the focus is on the P300 signals in EEG data. This requires a differentiation between the systems during the operational phases of the BCI system.

From given EEG recording, after some basic preprocessing operations, the processed EEG data of each channel is windowed into several frames and AR parameters are extracted using least-square Yule-Walker method. Considering the reflection coefficients from the autoregressive modeling, a set of features is extracted from the average of the coefficients of the specified frames.

The results raise expectations for improving the decodability of decisions in a broader context because the decision is an inherent part of the learning strategies. In this study, we investigated this possibility using various information theory-based methods. First, we trained a simple deep neural network to decode learning strategies from EEG signals collected while human subjects perform a strategy learning task with context changes. We then evaluated the ability of the model to decode subjective decision signals from EEG signals in another decision-making scenario that was not used during training. This zero-training scheme allows us to investigate whether the learning strategy decoder gleans information generalizable to various decision-making scenarios. Notably, we found that the decoder contains a significant amount of mutual information between input, hidden, and output for the new data (decision-making task; ), as well as the original training data (strategy learning task; ). In subsequent analyses of the neural representations of the model's hidden layers, we found informative features for decoding decisions in its deep layers.

Currently, most artifact removal models fail to ensure semantic consistency, rendering them ineffective. To solve it, we propose an artifact removal model based on the 1-dimensional diffusion model utilizing the U-Net, referred to as Essentia. Moreover, we find that the skip-connection layer in U-Net contains mid-to-high-frequency information that interferes with the semantic representation. We introduce a semantic guidance module (SGM) that leverages contrastive learning to generate semantic distribution weights, boosting semantic representation.

It is observed that the ANN's predictive ability is improved after preprocessing EEG signals using a particular nonlinear modeling technique, viz. a bilinear model, compared with those obtained by using a particular classical linear analysis method, viz. an autoregressive (AR) model. Until recently, linear time-invariant Gaussian modeling has dominated the development of time series modeling and feature extraction. The advantage of such classical models lies in the fact that a complete signal processing theory is available. In the case of EEG signals, where the underlying theory regarding the dynamical law governing the generation of these signals (e,g., the underlying physiological factors) is not completely understood, a case can be made for using improved signal processing models that are not subject to linear constraints. Such models should recognize important features of the observed data that may not be well modeled by a linear time-invariant model. It is known that EEG signals are nonstationary, and it is possible that they may be nonlinear as well. Thus, one way of gaining further insights on the structure of EEG signals is to introduce nonlinear models and higher order spectra. This paper compares the results of classification using a linear AR model with those obtained from a bilinear model. It is shown that in certain cases, the nonlinearity of the EEG signals is an important factor that ought to be taken into consideration during preprocessing of the signals prior to the classification task.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.564171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=564171","","Electroencephalography;Pattern classification;Brain modeling;Signal processing;Predictive models;Artificial neural networks;Signal analysis;Feature extraction;Signal generators;Constraint theory","","71","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, raw EEG signals were prone to noise contamination, such as electromyography artifacts from muscle movements and electrooculography artifacts from eye blinking, which could adversely impact signal analysis. To overcome this challenge, we employed pre-processing techniques involving fourth-order Butterworth filters and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reject and reduce noise from the EEG data.

One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50% when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013).

However, the CSP method easily overfits to the data of small training sets and its performance can be degraded by highly noisy and interference channels. Furthermore, more recording channels imply more processing and computation time in practical applications. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel sparse CSP algorithm by introducing sparsity into spatial filters.

To improve computational efficiency, an iterative approach based on general eigenvalue decomposition is further developed.

However, EEG signals are contained by different noises. This report presents efficient reconstruction and denoising of EEG signal based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely explored due to its broad applications, and its convergence has been gotten in the real field. This report discusses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a simple but powerful algorithm that is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to problems arising in applied statistics and machine learning. It takes the form of a decomposition-coordination procedure, in which the solutions to small local subproblems are coordinated to find a solution to a large global problem. The algorithm in the report show that the proposed ADMM-based method performs better in EEG-denoising than Compress Sensing (CS) method which is simple and traditional method. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm keeps the detail of the EEG-Signal in reconstruction and achieves smaller root means square error (RMSE) for small-iteration.","2831-3984","978-1-6654-5480-3","10.1109/ICISPC57208.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040504","EEG;ADMM;convex optimization;compress sensing","Surface reconstruction;Machine learning algorithms;Noise reduction;Scalp;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Electroencephalography","","1","","21","IEEE","10 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finding and extracting discriminative biological markers, which are correlated to healthy brain pattern and alcoholic brain pattern, helps us to utilize automatic methods for detecting and classifying alcoholism. Many brain disorders could be detected by analysing the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this paper, for extracting the required markers we analyse the EEG signals for two groups of alcoholic and control subjects. Then by applying wavelet transform, band-limited EEG signals are decomposed into five frequency sub-bands. Also, the principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to choose the most information carrying channels. By examining various features from different frequency sub-bands, six discriminative features for classification are selected. From functional brain network perspective, the lower synchronization in Beta frequency sub-band and loss of lateralization in Alpha frequency sub-band in alcoholic subjects are observed. Also from signal processing perspective we found that alcoholic subjects have lower values of fractal dimension, energy and entropy compared to control ones. Five different classifiers are used to classify these groups of alcoholic and control subjects that show very high accuracies (more than 90%). However, by comparing the performance of different classifiers, SVM, random forest and gradient boosting show the best performances with accuracies near 100%. Our study shows that fractal dimension, entropy and energy of channel C1 in Alpha frequency sub-band are the more important features for classification.","2372-9198","978-1-5386-1710-6","10.1109/CBMS.2017.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104182","Alcoholism;Brain Network;Classification;EEG;Feature Extraction;Brain Signal Processing","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Alcoholism;Entropy;Synchronization;Fractals;Principal component analysis","","16","","32","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed a modified independent component analysis (ICA) model for EMG artifact removal in the EEG data from TBI patients with a hemicraniectomy. Here, simulated EMG was generated and added to the raw EEG data as the extra channels for independent components calculation. After running ICA, the independent components (ICs) related to artifacts were identified and rejected automatically through several criteria. EEG data underlying hand movement from one healthy subject and one TBI patient with a hemicraniectomy were conducted to verify the efficacy of this algorithm. Results showed that the proposed algorithm removed sEMG artifacts from the EEG data by up to 86.72% while preserving the associated brain features. In particular, the high-gamma band (80 to 160 Hz) was found to arise principally from the hemicraniectomy area after this technique was applied.

Seizure morphology is known to evolve both temporally and spatially with a similar evolution also observed in the frequency domain. The modulation frequency analysis which is widely used in speech processing is used here to extract the frequency-localized spectral dynamics of the neonatal EEG and investigate their discriminative capabilities in the context of neonatal seizure detection. This study suggests that the spectral dynamics of neonatal EEG are more informative than short-term spectral characteristics. It is shown that the seizure-relevant components of the modulation spectrogram are found in the vicinity of 0.4Hz. Modulation frequency analysis represents a new insight into the EEG signal which can uncover the underlying time-structural organization of the neonatal EEG signal and therefore improve clinical understanding of the dynamic processes involved.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854731","Modulation frequency;neonatal EEG;neonatal seizures;epilepsy;electroencephalography","Electroencephalography;Pediatrics;Frequency modulation;Time-frequency analysis;Speech;Feature extraction","","","","32","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the scarcity of MI commands and the long calibration time, using the MI-based BCI system in practice is still challenging. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), which can recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training, has the potential to substantially reduce the calibration time. Thus, in this context, we first try to use a new type of motor imagery task, which is a combination of traditional tasks and propose a novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize both known and unknown categories of EEG signals. This is achieved by first learning a non-linear projection from EEG features to the target space and then applying a novelty detection method to differentiate unknown classes from known classes. Applications to a dataset collected from nine subjects confirm the possibility of identifying a new type of motor imagery only using already obtained motor imagery data. Results indicate that the classification accuracy of our zero-shot based method accounts for 91.81% of the traditional method which uses all categories of data.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3027004","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality for Project “Research on New Intelligent Perception Technology of Brain-Computer Interface Based on Augmented Reality”(grant numbers:18ZR1442700); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning for Project “The Brain Mechanism of Chinese Cognitive Processing”(grant numbers:TP2018056); Shanghai International Science and Technology Cooperation for Project “Research on Modeling and Analysis of High-Performance Deep Neural Networks for Children’s ADHD Nuclear Magnetic Big Data”(grant numbers:19490712800); Shanghai Health Commission for Project “Application of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Based on Task State EEG in Rehabilitation of Upper Limb Dysfunction After Stroke(grant numbers:20194Y0103); Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for Project “Research on Brain Plasticity of Multimodal Perception Feedback Training on Upper Limb Function Recovery After Stroke”(grant numbers:81902280); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207741","Zero-shot learning;brain-computer interface;motor imagery;electroencephalogram (EEG)","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Training;Feature extraction;Calibration;Neuroimaging","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Learning","25","","43","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system distinguishes between `Normal' and `Seizure' state using on-the-fly calculated features representing the statistical measures for specifically filtered signals from the raw data. It was noticed that for a large number of cases, the seizure waveforms manifest higher energy components during the seizure episodes as compared to the normal brain activity in specific bands of frequencies. Same is also true in the reverse fashion for a separate band of frequency that changes the energy levels from higher to lower when a patient goes from Normal to a Seizure state. This fact has been exploited in this paper and filter has been developed to isolate the seizure band. The rule base has been developed on the calculated measures for the filtered signal from this band-filter and classification is performed on the basis of certain empirical thresholds. Since the complexity of calculations have been deliberately kept quite low, the algorithm is highly suitable for implementation in a small micro-controller environment with near-real-time operation. This gives an enhanced advantage over the existing EEG based seizure detection systems due to their complex pattern classification methodologies. Based on the presented technique, a wearable ubiquitous system can be easily developed with applications in personal healthcare and clinical usage. In this case, the users are not necessarily restricted to the clinical environment in which many devices are connected to the patient externally. The wearable devices allow the user to continue daily activities while being monitored for seizure activities. Once seizure is detected, a number of possible usages can be employed such as alerting the user while driving/holding a baby etc.","","978-1-4799-2027-3","10.1109/TENCONSpring.2014.6862995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862995","Embedded system;Seizure;Wearable system;classification;filters","Electroencephalography;Microcontrollers;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Band-pass filters;Signal processing algorithms;IIR filters","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to decode the attended talker from neural signals to enhance their speech and improve perception. However, whether this decoding remains reliable under severely degraded listening conditions remains unclear. In this study, we investigated selective neural tracking of the attended speaker under adverse listening conditions. Using EEG recordings in a multi-talker speech perception task with varying SNR, participants' task performance—quantified through a repeated-word detection task—was analyzed as a proxy for perceptual accuracy and attentional focus, while neural responses were used to decode the attended talker. Despite substantial degradation in task performance, we found that neural tracking of attended speech persists, suggesting that the brain retains sufficient information for decoding. These findings demonstrate that even in highly challenging conditions, AAD remains feasible, offering a potential avenue for improving speech perception in brain-informed audio technologies, such as hearing aids, that leverage AAD to enhance listening experiences in real-world noisy environments.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-6874-1","10.1109/ICASSP49660.2025.10889263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10889263","Speech Perception;Auditory Attention Decoding;EEG;Brain-informed Hearing Aids","Degradation;Communication systems;Speech enhancement;Hearing aids;Electroencephalography;Decoding;Recording;Noise measurement;Reliability;Signal to noise ratio","","","","31","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, the two-class subproblems are simply learned by individual smaller network modules in parallel. Finally, all the individual trained network modules are integrated into a hierarchical, parallel, and modular classifier according to two module combination laws. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we perform simulations on fifteen different four-class EEG classification tasks, each of which consists of 1491 training and 636 test data. These EEG classification tasks were created using a set of non-averaged, single-trial hippocampal EEG signals recorded from rats; the features of the EEG signals are extracted using wavelet transform techniques. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has several attractive features. 1) The method is appreciably faster than the existing approach that is based on conventional multilayer perceptrons. 2) Complete learning of complex EEG classification problems can be easily realized, and better generalization performance can be achieved. 3) The method scales up to large-scale, complex EEG classification problems.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.821023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268228","","Electroencephalography;Neural networks;Large-scale systems;Performance evaluation;Brain modeling;Testing;Rats;Data mining;Wavelet transforms;Multilayer perceptrons","Algorithms;Animals;Cognition;Computing Methodologies;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Expert Systems;Hippocampus;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Rats;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","17","","33","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, BCI’s can now provide a wide new range of possibilities in the way users interact with a computer system (e.g., neuroadaptive interfaces).

However, performance differences still exist between the laboratory and the real world environments. One of the main reasons for such differences comes from the user’s unstable physical states (e.g., human movements are not strictly controlled), which produce unexpected signal artifacts. Hence, to minimize the performance degradation of electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCIs, we present a novel artifact removal method named constrained independent component analysis with online learning (cIOL). The cIOL can find and reject the noise-like components related to human body movements (i.e., movement artifacts) in the EEG signals. To obtain movement information, isolated electrodes are used to block electrical signals from the brain using high-resistance materials. We estimate artifacts with movement information using constrained independent component analysis from EEG signals and then extract artifact-free signals using online learning in each sample. In addition, the cIOL is evaluated by signal processing under 16 different experimental conditions (two types of EEG devices  $\times $  two BCI paradigms  $\times $  four different walking speeds). The experimental results show that the cIOL has the highest accuracy in both scalp- and ear-EEG, and has the highest signal-to-noise ratio in scalp-EEG among the state-of-the-art methods, except for the case of steady-state visual evoked potential at 2.0 m/s with superposition problem.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3040264","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of BCI based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions Using Deep Learning)(grant numbers:2017-0-00451,2015-0-00185,2019-0-00079); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269008","Electroencephalography (EEG);artifact removal;constrained independent component analysis (cICA);online learning;ambulatory environment","Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Scalp;Visualization;Steady-state;Task analysis;Signal to noise ratio","Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Humans;Movement;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","23","","53","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with other biomedical signals, very few papers have reported to eliminate electromyography (EMG) from EEG signals. However, the existing deep leaning models still have the potential of improvement. Motivated by these prior works, we propose a novel joint SSA and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to remove EMG from EEG signals.

A new yet under-explored BCI control paradigm is Motion Trajectory Prediction (MTP). While MTP provides continuous control signals suitable for high-precision tasks, its feasibility and applications are challenged by the low signal-to-noise ratio, especially in noninvasive settings. Previous research has predominantly focused on kinematic reconstruction of upper (e.g., arm reaching) and lower limbs (e.g., gait). However, finger movements have received much less attention, despite their crucial role in daily activities. To address this gap, our study explores the potential of noninvasive Electroencephalography (EEG) for reconstructing finger movements, specifically during hand grasping actions. A new experimental paradigm to collect multichannel EEG data from 20 healthy subjects, while performing full, natural hand opening and closing movements, was designed. Employing state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, continuous decoding models were constructed for eight key finger joints. The Convolutional Neural Network with Attention approach achieved an average decoding performance of r=0.63. Furthermore, a post-hoc metric was proposed for hand grasp cycle detection, and 83.5% of hand grasps were successfully detected from the reconstructed motion signals, which can potentially serve as a new BCI command. Explainable AI algorithm was also applied to analyze the topographical relevance of trained features. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG to reconstruct hand joint movements and highlight the potential of MTP-BCI in control and rehabilitation applications.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781850","Brain-Computer Interface;deep learning;electroencephalography;motion reconstruction","Deep learning;Neuroprostheses;Grasping;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Trajectory;Robots;Signal to noise ratio","Humans;Electroencephalography;Deep Learning;Hand Strength;Movement;Hand;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Male;Algorithms;Adult;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Female","","","9","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, studies also suggest that attention induces a spatially specific alpha power increase and decrease in respective hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the locus of attended speech. This finding motivates us to design XAnet, a neuroscience-inspired network for Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD). In XAnet, neural activity measured by ElectroEncephalography (EEG) is first divided into left and right-side EEG channel groups and then integrated as cross-attention to capture differentiated left and right-side responses of the brain.

In the case of discriminating two classes of signals, EEG signals are projected onto a space where one class of signals is maximally scattered and the other is minimally scattered. This paper finds a minimal number of electrodes that can achieve the discrimination. Applying many electrodes is tedious and time-consuming. To reduce the number of electrodes, we propose inducing sparsity in the spatial filter.

To achieve this, signals are measured from both the brain and forearm muscles and EMG data is gathered from a 4-class gesture classification experiment via the Myo Armband, and a 3-class mental state EEG dataset is acquired via the Muse EEG Headband. A hyperheuristic multi-objective evolutionary search method is used to find the best network hyperparameters. We then use this optimised topology of deep neural network to classify both EMG and EEG signals, attaining results of 84.76% and 62.37% accuracy, respectively. Next, when pre-trained weights from the EMG classification model are used for initial distribution rather than random weight initialisation for EEG classification, 93.82%(+29.95) accuracy is reached. When EEG pre-trained weights are used for initial weight distribution for EMG, 85.12% (+0.36) accuracy is achieved. When the EMG network attempts to classify EEG, it outperforms the EEG network even without any training (+30.25% to 82.39% at epoch 0), and similarly the EEG network attempting to classify EMG data outperforms the EMG network (+2.38% at epoch 0). All transfer networks achieve higher pre-training abilities, curves, and asymptotes, indicating that knowledge transfer is possible between the two signal domains. In a second experiment with CNN transfer learning, the same datasets are projected as 2D images and the same learning process is carried out. In the CNN experiment, EMG to EEG transfer learning is found to be successful but not vice-versa, although EEG to EMG transfer learning did exhibit a higher starting classification accuracy. The significance of this work is due to the successful transfer of ability between models trained on two different biological signal domains, reducing the need for building more computationally complex models in future research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979074","U.K. ACADEMIES - RESEARCH MOBILITY PI 02/2018 in Partnership with CONFAP-Brazil; Funda????o Arauc??ria(grant numbers:50715.538.33202.06072018); Aston University; Federal University of Parana, Brazil; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9027853","Applied machine learning;biological signal processing;EEG;EMG;knowledge adaptation;neural networks;transfer learning","Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Brain modeling;Signal processing;Muscles;Neural networks","","68","","70","CCBY","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are more suitable for monitoring brain activity and detecting brain disorders.

The effectiveness of epilepsy detection primarily hinges on the architecture of deep neural network models. Thus, this study proposes a Multi-Scale Multi-Level Temporal-Spatial Attention CNN model (MSMLTSACNN), which includes the Multi-Scale Multi-Level Attention Module (MSMLAM), the Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction Module (STFEM), the Scale Feature Reconstruction Module (SFRM) and the Classification Module (CM). Firstly, MSMLAM is used to extract the multi-scale features of epileptic EEG signals. Then, for each scale feature, the information flow between electrodes is acquired at three hierarchical levels, and the three-level features of the current scale are integrated by using the attention-weighted mechanism. Furthermore, STFEM, SFRM and CM are employed successively to extract, rerepresent and classify the multi-scale temporal-spatial features. Through five-fold cross-validation experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset, the MSMLTSACNN model achieved favorable results in terms of sensitivity (98.97%), F1 score (98.68%), accuracy (98.78%), and precision (98.57%). The results indicate that MSMLTSACNN can effectively improves epileptic seizure detection performance by extracting more representative multi-scale features based on the multi-level information flow between electrodes of EEG signals.","1934-1768","978-9-8875-8158-1","10.23919/CCC63176.2024.10662652","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10662652","electroencephalogram signal (EEG);brain networks;deep learning;seizure detection;convolutional Neural network","Electrodes;Sensitivity;Accuracy;Epilepsy;Human factors;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","","","14","","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the 1970s, after nearly half a century of development, it has been used in many fields such as medical care. In recent years, imaginary speech has emerged as a new neural paradigm based on internal arousal of brain activity for natural communication without the need for auditory language. Since no features suitable for imaginary speech have been found, many studies are underway, including traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and other deep learning methods. In this paper, instantaneous frequency and power spectral entropy are used as the characteristics of imaginary speech EEG signals. On this basis, the twin neural network is used to compare the similarity of different categories of imaginary pronunciations for distance learning. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm analyzes the above features and realizes the classification of imaginary speech. The experimental results show that the method can effectively recognize the two-class imaginary speech, and the recognition accuracy is better than the traditional algorithm.","","978-1-6654-9563-9","10.1109/ICSIP55141.2022.9887230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887230","Siamese neural network;Imagined speech;EEG;BCI","Support vector machines;Image recognition;Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Entropy","","1","","24","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was used to analyze EEG slow wave activity during anesthesia in ten post-CA patients. The recordings were made in the intensive care unit 36-48 hours after the CA in an experiment, during which the propofol infusion rate was incrementally decreased to determine the drug-induced changes in the EEG at different anesthetic levels. HHT was shown to successfully capture the changes in the slow wave activity to the behavior of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). While, in patients with good neurological outcome defined after a six-month control period, propofol induced a significant increase in the amplitude of IMFs representing the slow wave activity, the patients with poor neurological outcome were unable to produce such a response. Consequently, the proposed method offer substantial prognostic potential by providing a novel approach for early estimation of HIE after CA.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0220-4","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591080","","Electroencephalography;Anesthesia;Hospitals;Blood;Cardiac arrest;Brain injuries;Estimation","Algorithms;Anesthesia;Electroencephalography;Heart Arrest;Humans;Propofol;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","2","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Auditory oddball P300 have been found to be one of the most consistent markers of schizophrenia. The goal of this study is to find quantitative features that can objectively distinguish patients with schizophrenia (SCZs) from healthy controls (HCs) based on their recorded auditory odd-ball P300 electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Methods: Using EEG dataset, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm to distinguish 57 SCZs from 66 HCs. The proposed ML algorithm has three steps. In the first step, a brain source localization (BSL) procedure using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach is employed on EEG signals to extract source waveforms from 30 specified brain regions. In the second step, a method for estimating effective connectivity, referred to as symbolic transfer entropy (STE), is applied to the source waveforms. In the third step the ML algorithm is applied to the STE connectivity matrix to determine whether a set of features can be found that successfully discriminate SCZ from HC. Results: The findings revealed that the SCZs have significantly higher effective connectivity compared to HCs and the selected STE features could achieve an accuracy of 92.68%, with a sensitivity of 92.98% and specificity of 92.42%. Conclusion: The findings imply that the extracted features are from the regions that are mainly affected by SCZ and can be used to distinguish SCZs from HCs. Significance: The proposed ML algorithm may prove to be a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2020.3011842","New York Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367249","Effective connectivity;electroencephalography (EEG);EEG beamforming;machine learning;odd-ball\paradigm;schizophrenia;symbolic transfer entropy","Entropy;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain;Standards;Signal processing algorithms;Location awareness","Brain;Electroencephalography;Humans;Machine Learning;Schizophrenia;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","19","","78","IEEE","3 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first one scales the observations in such a way that implicitly normalizes the common temporal strength of the source activities. When the scaling applies independently to the trials of the observations, the procedure justifies and improves the classical preprocessing for the EEG data. In addition, when the scaling is instantaneous and independent for each sample, the procedure particularizes to Tyler’s method in statistics for obtaining a distribution-free estimate of scattering. In this case, the proposal provides an original interpretation of this existing method as a technique that pursuits an implicit instantaneous power-normalization of the underlying source processes. The second technique applies to the classifier and improves its performance through a convenient regularization of the features covariance matrix.

We have investigated which electrodes are the most relevant for performing an EEG-based classifier of oddball sounds using tones and nonsense syllables so that eventually a minimal set of electrodes may be used in a portable auditory-based EEG BCI system. And we have described the modular design of a portable hearing aid system which enables interchange of different USB-enabled EEG electrodes, codecs, and battery supplies. The system includes a dual-microphone array for enabling adaptive beamforming noise cancelation and a Linux-based processor for performing advanced noise cancelation and compression algorithms.","1948-3554","978-1-4673-1969-0","10.1109/NER.2013.6695964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6695964","","Electroencephalography;Auditory system;Electrodes;Microphones;Array signal processing;Accuracy;Codecs","","1","","11","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several studies show that combining multiple signals improves the accuracy of estimating complex states compared to using a single signal. However, the effective processing and integration of heterogeneous signal types continues to pose significant challenges. In this paper, a method is proposed to combine EEG and ECG with various artificial intelligence (AI) models to estimate and analyze learning understanding. In the proposed method, EEG and ECG features are extracted by various AI models, and these features are combined to classify the presence or absence of understanding. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and EEGNet are employed for EEG feature extraction, and LSTM, GRU, and CNN are employed for ECG feature extraction. The combination patterns are all combinations of each feature extraction AI model. In experiments, participants answer “I understand” or “I do not understand” to an IQ test, while EEG and ECG are recorded. The proposed method is validated and analyzed with EEG and ECG obtained from experiments. In experimental results, the combined model performed best in precision $(\mathbf{75.7}\% \pm \mathbf{0.9}\%)$ and sensitivity $(\mathbf{83.0}\% \pm \mathbf{2.0}\%)$ when a CNN was employed to extract EEG and ECG features. In addition, the comparison of each pattern confirmed that there were differences in the tendency of misidentification data depending on the combined model. The results suggest the effectiveness of the CNN-based combination of EEG and ECG. Also, Comparison of each pattern revealed effective processing and issues for the combination of EEG and ECG, respectively.","","979-8-3315-0649-0","10.1109/ICICYTA64807.2024.10913149","Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22K12221); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10913149","AI;EEG;ECG;learning understanding","Analytical models;Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Learning (artificial intelligence);Electrocardiography;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Data models;Convolutional neural networks","","","","12","IEEE","11 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given that GNNs can accommodate dynamic and variablesized data as input, we hypothesize their potential for superior performance compared to traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which rigidly fix the distance among electrodes in a pixel-like matrix. Furthermore, GNNs are designed to leverage the biological topology between different brain regions, capturing both local and global relationships among EEG channels. In this study, two GNN models are experimented with: a Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) and a Regularized Graph Neural Network (RGNN). Results indicate that the DGCNN model proposed in this work outperforms state-of-the-art models and the RGNN, achieving an average accuracy of 95%, compared to 53% for the latter.

The channels most closely correlated with brain activity are extracted using a correlation-based connectivity matrix for fNIRS and EEG separately. Furthermore, the training vector is formed through the identification and fusion of the statistical features of both modalities (i.e., slope, skewness, maximum, skewness, mean, and kurtosis). The constructed fused feature vector is passed through various filters (including ReliefF, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, chi-square test, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis filters) to remove redundant information before training. Traditional classifiers such as neural networks, support-vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and ensembles were used for the purpose of training and testing. A publicly available dataset with motor imagery information was used for validation of the proposed approach. Our findings indicate that the proposed correlation-filter-based channel and feature selection framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy of hybrid EEG-fNIRS.

Therefore, to improve the performance of CNN toward EEG multispectral image classification, a multi-view convolutional neural network (MVCNN) classification model based on inceptionV1 is designed in this study. This model mainly improves and optimizes the convolutional layers and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the convolutional architecture model.

Then the learning rate change function of the SGD was optimized to increase the classification performance.

Leveraging a recently introduced, publicly available neuromarketing dataset, we explore the relationship between brain activity captured via Electroencephalo-graphic (EEG), and consumer profiling, as elicited through questionnaires. Functional connectivity (FC) descriptors are employed to delineate the functional brain structure and organization across different brain regions. To account for the dynamic nature of brain phenomena, FC matrices are computed over time in a subject-independent manner. We propose a novel methodology that employs the leading eigenvector of the FC matrices to extract dominant FC patterns associated with personality traits.

Supervised spatial filtering methods that enhance the discriminative information in EEG data are commonly used to improve single-trial ERP detection. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN is compared with three common classifiers: 1) Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; 2) multilayer perceptron (MLP); and 3) support vector machines. Prior to classification, the data were spatially filtered with xDAWN (for the maximization of the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio), common spatial pattern, or not spatially filtered. The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier. In addition, the nonlinear classifier MLP outperformed the linear methods. Finally, training based AUC maximization provided better performance than training based on the minimization of the mean square error. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the systems architecture is critical and both spatial filtering and classification must be considered together.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2302898","Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies through the U.S. Army Research Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737255","Brain-computer interface (BCI);common spatial patterns (CSP);convolution;electroencephalogram (EEG);neural networks;rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP);spatial filters.;Brain–computer interface (BCI);common spatial patterns (CSP);convolution;electroencephalogram (EEG);neural networks;rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP);spatial filters","Electroencephalography;Neurons;Visualization;Training;Sensors;Convolution;Biological neural networks","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Area Under Curve;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Female;Filtration;Humans;Male;Neural Networks (Computer);Photic Stimulation;ROC Curve;Reaction Time;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machine;Visual Perception;Young Adult","96","","61","IEEE","11 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed study focuses on maximizing the classification performance by combining two of the most successful methods: CSP (Common Spatial Patterns) and CNN. Three different setups have been established in order to observe the changes in the validation accuracy of the classifier. At first, a CNN (four convolution layers and a fully connected layer) structure is trained by feeding the raw data. Secondly, five different filters are applied to the original signal and their outputs are utilized in the training of a CNN having the same structure. Thirdly, the original signal has been transformed via CSP into another space where its spatial features are observed more clearly and then classified by the CNN. It is observed that the combination of CSP and CNN gives the best performance with 93.75% validation accuracy.","","978-1-7281-1013-4","10.1109/EBBT.2019.8741832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741832","EEG Motor Imagery;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Common Spatial Patterns","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks;Filter banks","","10","","16","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the changes of the physiological states and the relative environment exist when cognitive and information processing take place in different brain regions at different times, the practical EEGs therefore turn out to be extremely non-stationary processes. To investigate how these distributed brain regions are linked together and the information is exchanged with time, this paper proposes a modern time-frequency coherent analysis method that employs an alternative way for quantifying synchronization with both temporal and spatial resolution. Wavelet coherent spectrum is defined such that the degree of synchronization and information flow between different brain regions can be described. Several real EEG data are analysed under the cognitive tasks of sentences identification in both English and Chinese. The time-varying synchronization between the brain regions involved in the processing of sentences exhibited that a common neural network is activated by both English and Chinese sentences.

Phase synchronization (PS) method can be applied to detect the information flow and information exchange among different brain regions. In this paper, we aim to provide the diagnostic reference of deep coma patients and brain death patients based on EEG data and determine some potential clinical practice standards by using PS method. We first calculate the phase locking value (PLV) between the channel pairs located on the forehead among three types of patients (deep coma patients, brain death patients, and a patient from deep coma to brain death). Then the PLV differences between the two types of patients were analyzed based on different frequency bands, where the significance of the results was verified by the significant test (one-way ANOVA). Finally, the difference coefficient d is used to measure the degree of PS for two types of patients in different frequency bands. The results showed that the degree of PS in deep coma patients was significantly higher than that in brain death patients. This difference was more pronounced in the low frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and low beta), and the difference was most prominent in the alpha frequency band.","2164-5221","978-1-5386-4673-1","10.1109/ICSP.2018.8652349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8652349","deep coma;brain death;EEG;phase synchronization;phase locking value","Electroencephalography;Synchronization;Brain;Frequency measurement;Phase measurement;IP networks;Standards","","","","17","IEEE","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For some of these patients surgery may be an option: the brain region responsible for seizure onset may be removed surgically. However, this requires accurate delineation of the seizure onset region. Currently, the key to making this determination is seizure EEG. Therefore, EEG recordings must continue until enough seizures are obtained to determine the onset region; this may take about 5 days to several weeks. In some cases these recordings must be done using invasive electrodes, a procedure that includes substantial risk, discomfort and cost. In this paper, techniques are developed that use periods of intracranial non-seizure (ldquorestrdquo) EEG to localize epileptogenic networks. Analysis of intracranial EEG (recorded by surface and/or depth electrodes) of 6 epileptic patients shows that certain EEG channels and hence cortical regions are consistently more synchronous (ldquohypersynchronousrdquo) compared to others. It is shown that hypersynchrony seems to strongly correlate with the seizure onset zone; this phenomenon may in the long term allow to determine the seizure onset area(s) from non-seizure EEG, which in turn would enable shorter hospitalizations or even avoidance of semi-chronic implantations all-together.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332447","","Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Electrodes;Surgery;Brain;Scalp;USA Councils;Disk recording;Costs;Medical treatment","Automation;Biomedical Engineering;Brain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electrodes;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology;Epilepsy;Equipment Design;Humans;Regression Analysis;Seizures;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors","25","","15","IEEE","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method aims to establish the relationship between image quality changes and underlying brain responses in image compression scenarios using the electroencephalography (EEG) approach. We first establish EEG datasets by collecting the corresponding EEG signals when subjects watch distorted images. Then, we design a measurement model to extract EEG features that reflect human perception to establish a new image perceptual quality metric: EEG perceptual score (EPS). To use this metric in practical scenarios, we embed the brain perception process into a prediction model to generate the EPS directly from the input images. Experimental results show that our proposed measurement model and prediction model can achieve better performance.

Modeling the brain as a white box is vital for investigating the brain. However, the physical properties of the human brain are unclear.

This paper constructed a relation frame based on the independent and interactive compositions for intention recognition and analysis using a novel dendrite module of Gang neurons. A total of 4,906 EEG data of left- and right-hand motor imagery (MI) from 26 subjects were obtained from GigaDB. Firstly, this paper explored EEGG’s classification performance by cross-subject accuracy. Secondly, this paper transformed the trained EEGG model into a relation spectrum expressing independent and interactive components of brain regions.

(1) EEGG was more robust than typical “CSP+” algorithms for the low-quality data. (2) The relation spectrum showed the known ERD/ERS phenomenon. (3) Interestingly, EEGG showed that interactive components between brain regions suppressed ERD/ERS effects on classification. This means that generating fine hand intention needs more centralized activation in the brain. Significance.

Most of the analysis of the saccade-related EEG data has been performed using ensemble averaging approaches. However, ensemble averaging is not suitable for BCI. In order to process raw EEG data in real time, we performed saccade-related EEG experiments and processed data by using the non-conventional fast ICA with reference signal (FICAR). The FICAR algorithm can extract desired independent components (IC) which have strong correlation against a reference signal. Visually guided saccade tasks and auditory guided saccade tasks were performed and the EEG signal generated in the saccade was recorded. The EEG processing was performed in three stages: PCA preprocessing and noise reduction, extraction of the desired IC using Wiener filter with reference signal, and post-processing using higher order statistics fast ICA based on maximization of kurtosis. Form the experimental results and analysis we found that using FICAR it is possible to extract form raw EEG data the saccade-related ICs and to predict saccade in advance by about 10 [ms] before real movements of eyes occurs. For single trail EEG data we have successfully extracted the desire ICs with recognition rate about 70%. In next steps, saccade-related EEG signals and saccade-related ICs in visually and auditory guided saccade task are compared in the point of the latency between starting time of a saccade and time when a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value and in the point of the peak scale where a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value. As results, peak time when saccade-related ICs have maximum amplitude is earlier than peak time when saccade-related EEG signals have maximum amplitude.

On the one hand, raw EEG signal is the timing signal of multiple electrodes, so it's impossible to extract local features like a picture using convolutional filters. On the other hand, EEG data collection is rather cumbersome, so the amount of EEG data is much smaller than some large datasets such as ImageNet, which leads to deeper network more prone to overfitting on EEG datasets. In this paper, we propose a method for processing resting state EEG signals, which uses Fourier transform to convert time-series EEG signals into frequency-domain signals, and construct a CNN model according to the characteristics of EEG signal. We applied this method to personal identification and classification of gender and age. For personal identification, we achieved an accuracy of 95.5% on our dataset, and the accuracy of gender and age classification was 62.7% and 51.2% respectively.","","978-1-7281-0084-5","10.1109/ICNSC.2019.8743338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743338","convolutional neural network;resting state EEG;signal analysis","Electroencephalography;Convolution;Brain modeling;Kernel;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Data models","","","","19","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods: We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Results: Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment. Conclusion: The proposed Euclidean space EEG data alignment approach can greatly facilitate transfer learning in BCIs.

Second, we performed a graph theory analysis of the bipartite network composite of ROIs and independent processes to assess the connectivity between ROIs. We applied this proposed algorithm and compared the functional connectivity network properties under resting state condition using 29 student-athletes prior to and shortly after sport-related mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). The major findings of interest are the following. There was 1) alterations in vertex degree at frontal and occipital regions in subjects suffering from MTBI,  $({ p} < 0.05)$; 2) a significant decrease in the long-distance connectivity and significant increase in the short-distance connectivity as a result of MTBI, $({ p} < 0.05)$; 3) a departure from small-world network configuration in MTBI subjects.

The combination of source-imaging and analysis of cortical directional networks enables us to noninvasively explore the underlying neural processes. However, existing EEG source imaging approaches mainly focus on performing the direct inverse operation for source estimation, which will be inevitably influenced by noise and the strategy used to find the inverse solution. Here, we develop a new source imaging technique, Deep Brain Neural Network (DeepBraiNNet), for robust sparse spatiotemporal EEG source estimation. In DeepBraiNNet, considering that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are usually “deep” in temporal dimension and thus suitable for time sequence modelling, the RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized to approximate the inverse operation for the lead field matrix instead of performing the direct inverse operation, which avoids the possible effect of the direct inverse operation on the underdetermined lead field matrix prone to be influenced by noise. Simulations on various source patterns and noise conditions confirmed that the proposed approach could actually recover the spatiotemporal sources well, outperforming existing state of-the-art methods. DeepBraiNNet also estimated sparse MI related activation patterns when it was applied to a real Motor Imagery dataset, consistent with other findings based on EEG and fMRI. Based on the spatiotemporal sources estimated from DeepBraiNNet, we constructed MI related cortical neural networks, which clearly exhibited strong contralateral network patterns for the two MI tasks. Consequently, DeepBraiNNet may provide an alternative way different from the conventional approaches for spatiotemporal EEG source imaging.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2021.3097758","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19A2082,61961160705,81771925,71601136); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2018JY0526); ARC DECRA Fellowship(grant numbers:DE220100265); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488247","Cortical neural networks;long short-term memory network;EEG source imaging;spatiotemporal EEG sources","Electroencephalography;Imaging;Scalp;Lead;Deep learning;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Inverse problems","Brain;Electroencephalography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer","25","","62","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The raw EEG signal obtained during the motor imagery (MI) of a BCI user is intrinsically embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual signal is still a mystery. The proposed work in the field of recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) is designed to filter such non-Gaussian noise using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the signal type. The proposed learning architecture has been modified to do away with the Hebbian learning associated with the existing RQNN architecture as this learning scheme was found to be unstable for complex signals such as EEG. Besides, this the soliton behaviour of the non-linear SWE was not properly preserved in the existing scheme. The unsupervised learning algorithm proposed in this paper is able to efficiently capture the statistical behaviour of the input signal while making the algorithm robust to parametric sensitivity. This denoised EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. It is shown that the accuracy of the classifier output over the training and the evaluation datasets using the filtered EEG is much higher compared to that using the raw EEG signal.

This paper proposes an NMM based computational model of mild TBI that recreates the clinical EEG changes observed after injury. Specifically, the focus is on recreating changes observed after TBI in the 8-12 Hz alpha and the 4-8Hz theta frequency ranges. Mild TBI is simulated by increasing membrane reactivity and by decreasing synaptic connectivity in the NMM.

For people who are paralysed, BCI acts as an interface to control and regulate external devices and replaces their lost motor functionality, using brain activity alone. A motor imagery BCI translates a person's imagination about a movement into control signals which in turn controls the intended device. For this, the EEG signals that are produced according to the motor imaging need to be processed and analysed using various signal processing algorithms. During a motor activity, only the sensorimotor rhythms, which are the μ and β rhythms, get activated. Wavelet decomposition, which could provide both frequency and time localization, is employed to extract the sensorimotor rhythms. Since different brain regions are dependent during an activity, the correlation between the EEG channels must also be considered during the extraction of features. For this, Bayesian Network approach is used to obtain the maximum probable channels during each motor activity. Most of the BCI systems are subject specific systems.

Around 15-30% of people are unable to control a BCI accurately; this is known as the BCI illiteracy problem. However, the problem may lie more with the BCI designer than with the user. Here we explore three potential sources of variability that may contribute to so-called BCI illiteracy, and solutions that may help overcome each one. These approaches bring us closer to having individualized, open-ended BCIs. First, we examine the impact of individual expertise. We show that people who have specialized expertise can often master a mental-imagery-driven BCI task when that task is well matched to their specific training, such as auditory imagery tasks for those with music training. Second, we take into account the high individual variability in brain structure, by using beamforming to transform the EEG signal from electrode space to the spatial coordinates of the brain; we show that individually trained classifiers, when fed features derived from source space, are much more accurate when users are performing non-conventional mental imagery tasks. Third, in our ongoing and future research, we are addressing the issue of cognitive variability – the fact that individuals may perform mental imagery tasks using very different cognitive strategies and engage correspondingly different functional networks. We will have BCI users perform a large battery of imagery tasks based on ""approach"" versus ""avoidance"" behaviours. Given that approach versus avoidance processes differentially recruit left versus right hemispheric networks, respectively, we predict that each user will be able to generate highly distinctive and discriminable brain signatures for at least two of these tasks, leading to accurate classification by a BCI.

In this paper, the novel EL method with multiple base classifiers was studied in the context of MI-classification. In view of the importance of spatial filter in BCI construction, we focused on the spatial filter design based on a small number of training samples.

This implemented by means of a 3-layer perceptron artificial neural network trained by a backpropagation algorithm. System performance was measured as the percentage increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of predetermined epileptiform discharges in recorded EEG segments.

Despite recent advancements, Transformer-based decoding methods often neglect the explicit temporal priors inherent in EEG signals, i.e., the dependency between tokens tends to diminish as their relative temporal distance increases, which limits the efficacy of these decoding approaches. Inspired by the recent Retentive Network (RetNet), we develop a novel convolutional retentive network for EEG decoding (RetEEG), which integrates temporal priors into the self-attention mechanism to tackle the above challenge. Specifically, RetEEG incorporates a convolution module to capture local EEG features and cascades multiple bidirectional retention modules to learn global correlations within these local features. The bidirectional retention module introduces a temporal decay matrix, which imparts prior knowledge to the self-attention mechanism by accounting for variations in relative temporal distances. To validate the superiority of RetEEG, we conducted experiments on two publicly available EEG datasets. The experimental results empirically demonstrate that the proposed RetEEG achieves the state-of-the-art EEG decoding performance.

The performance of stimulator depends on many factors such as size and shape of stimulator, frequency of stimulation, luminance, color, and subject attention. Information Transfer Rate (ITR) varies with the change of frequency and size of the visual stimuli. In our research, a Circular Repetitive Visual Stimulator (CRVS) of different diameters (2″, 2.5″ and 3″), colors (RGB), frequencies (10, 15 and 20 Hz) was used. The raw EEG signal is processed for finding the effect of diverse stimulation on alpha band of EEG signal at diverse condition. From the analysis it is found that, when the size of the stimulator changes from 2″ to 2.5″, resultant increase in alpha wave is 58.18%. But for a further increase in size from 2.5″ to 3″, there is a resultant decrease in alpha wave of 45%.

Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a single type of connectivity measure. Methods: We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions using different fusion strategies. We also consider an extension to dynamic brain connectivity using the recurrent neural networks. Results: Hierarchical latent representations learned by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveals apparent group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifier. The MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of 91.69% with a decision-level fusion. Conclusion: The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from diverse brain connectivity descriptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ from HC. Significance: The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other disorders.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2941222","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia(grant numbers:Q.J130000.2545.19H3,R.J130000.7851.5F157,R.J130000.7845.4L840); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836535","EEG;brain connectivity networks;deep learning;convolution neural networks;ensemble classifiers","Electroencephalography;Reactive power;Time measurement;Frequency-domain analysis;Brain modeling","Adolescent;Child;Connectome;Deep Learning;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Schizophrenia;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","117","","54","IEEE","13 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a pilot study using a custom-made neurofeedback videogame called Harvest Challenge is presented. The videogame uses a low-cost Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to measure the attention levels of players in order to use them as an input control in the videogame. We carry out 2-sessions intervention with 7 children with ADHD attempting to find improvements in sustained attention levels. Furthermore, we recorded the EEG signals during a resting state in order to neurophysiologically characterize the children. Results revealed improvements in the sustained attention levels of players (measured by game metrics) as well as higher resting values in the power of alpha and beta bands rather than Delta and Theta. A statistical relationship between the power of the Theta band during resting and the time to accomplish the first game level was found indicating important game correlates with brain activity. Finally, we exposed the development of a software tool to simplify the EEG signal processing from low-cost BCI sensors highlighting its promising usefulness in user experience studies.","","978-1-5090-2966-2","10.1109/ColumbianCC.2016.7750788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7750788","neurofeedback;videogame;ADHD;brain computer interface;EEG;physiological signals","Electroencephalography;Pediatrics;Games;Sensors;Neurofeedback;Signal processing;Medical treatment","","31","","32","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, which condition can induce the activation is still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify brain activation conditions using 40 Hz monaural beat (MB). Under this stimulation, auditory sense status which is determined by frequency and power range is the condition to consider. Hence, we designed five sessions to compare; no stimulation, audible (AB), inaudible in frequency, inaudible in power, and inaudible in frequency and power. Ten healthy participants underwent each stimulation session for ten minutes with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. For analysis, we calculated the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG for each session and compared them in frequency, time, and five brain regions. As a result, we observed the prominent power peak at 40 Hz in only AB. The induced EEG amplitude increase started at one minute and increased until the end of the session. These results of AB had significant differences in frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions compared to other stimulations. From the statistical analysis, the PSD of the right temporal region was significantly higher than the left. We figure out the role that the auditory sense is important to lead brain activation. These findings help to understand the neurophysiological principle and effects of auditory stimulation.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340294","Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340294","brain modulation;monaural beat;sense;electroencephalogram","Brain;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency modulation;Statistical analysis;Electroencephalography;Biology;Recording","Humans;Brain;Electroencephalography;Hearing;Acoustic Stimulation;Brain Mapping","2","","20","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The information transfer rate of BCI has been significantly improved by a lot of cutting-edge methods. The exploration of effective preprocessing in brain-computer interfaces, particularly in terms of identifying suitable preprocessing methods and determining the optimal sequence for their application, remains an area ripe for further investigation. To address this gap, this study explores a range of preprocessing techniques, including but not limited to independent component analysis, surface Laplacian, bandpass filtering, and baseline correction, examining their potential contributions and synergies in the context of BCI applications. In this extensive research, a variety of preprocessing pipelines were rigorously tested across four EEG data sets, all of which were pertinent to motor imagery-based BCIs. These tests incorporated five EEG machine learning models, working in tandem with the preprocessing methods discussed earlier. The study's results highlighted that baseline correction and bandpass filtering consistently provided the most beneficial preprocessing effects. From the perspective of online deployment, after testing and time complexity analysis, this study recommends baseline correction, bandpass filtering and surface Laplace as more suitable for online implementation. An interesting revelation of the study was the enhanced effectiveness of the surface Laplacian algorithm when used alongside algorithms that focus on spatial information. Using appropriate processing algorithms, we can even achieve results (92.91% and 88.11%) that exceed the SOTA feature extraction methods in some cases. Such findings are instrumental in offering critical insights for the selection of effective preprocessing pipelines in EEG signal decoding.

Previous work has failed to fully utilize the spatial topological information between brain regions. (2) Most methods have focused solely on seizure signal detection, and how to predict the next seizure and realize early warning is more clinically valuable for timely treatment of epileptic patients. To address the above problems, we propose a new spatial-temporal graph neural network for seizure detection and prediction. Specifically, we construct two brain graphs based on static physical distance and dynamic functional connections. By employing temporal and spatial attention mechanisms, we extract spatiotemporal information from EEG signals and further leverage graph convolutional networks to capture inter-channel relationships. By transforming the seizure prediction task into a multi-class classification, our method automatically identifies pre-ictal signals, enabling the prediction of seizure occurrences.

In order to process raw EEG data in real time, we performed saccade-related EEG experiments and processed data by using the non-conventional fast ICA with reference signal (FICAR). Visually guided saccade tasks and auditorily guided saccade tasks were performed and the EEG signal generated in the saccade was recorded. As results, for single trail EEG data we have successfully extracted the desire ICs with recognition rate about 70%. In next steps, saccade-related EEG signals and saccade-related ICs in visually and auditorily guided saccade task are compared in the point of the latency between starting time of a saccade and time when a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value and in the point of the peak scale where a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value. As results, peak time when saccade-related ICs have maximum amplitude is earlier than peak time when saccade-related EEG signals have maximum amplitude.

Accurate and early diagnosis of this disorder in preschool ages can help the control process and prevent the school problems caused by ADHD. Medical methods for preschool-age children can be problematic and slow down the control process. In these cases, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are useful and efficient tools, because of the non-invasiveness, being quite available, and having high temporal resolution. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect ADHD/Normal EEG signals recorded from children in an online and open access dataset. Our proposed method uses the Structural and Functional information of the EEG signals. Structural and functional based features were extracted using Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Graph Learning (GL) techniques, respectively, which are the generalization of the Classic methods and can consider EEG signals as graph signals on the underlying graph of electrodes. We reached detection accuracies of 79.03% and 82.36% for using GSP and GL based features, respectively.

Because high-voltage stimulation artifacts tend to completely dominate the simultaneously recorded EEG and vary slightly trial by trial in both amplitude and phase, the majority of studies to date have simply compared poststimulation and prestimulation periods. Here, we propose the use of a modified joint blind source separation (JBSS) approach for removing stimulation artifacts when the same stimulus is applied in multiple epochs. Methods: quadrature regression and subsequent independent vector analysis (q-IVA) was applied to simulated and real EEG datasets recorded from ten subjects who received theta-band galvanic vestibular stimulation. Results: in simulations, q-IVA and JBSS approaches significantly improved the relative root-mean-squared error, correlation coefficient, and power deviation between the original and recovered EEG compared to conventional methods. In the real EEG data, after removing the artifacts with q-IVA, the power spectra during stimulation demonstrated significantly enhanced beta and gamma power compared to prestimulation, becoming similar to that seen in immediate poststimulation periods. In addition, we demonstrate that increased alpha power (8-13 Hz) in occipital regions with eye closure could be reliably detected in the cleaned EEG data after applying q-IVA. Conclusion: q-IVA and JBSS approaches outperform conventional artifact removal methods in both time and frequency domains. Significance: our results provide a promising way to effectively isolate stimulation artifacts in EEG, paving the way for future studies attempting to uncover ongoing modulation of brain activity during NEBS.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2018.2828808","Mottershead Foundation; Pacific Parkinson's Research Institute/UBC Chair in Parkinson's disease (MJM); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501164,81571760); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8344110","Noninvasive electrical brain stimulation;artifact removal;EEG;joint blind source separation (JBSS);independent vector analysis (IVA)","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Principal component analysis;Protocols;Electrical stimulation","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Middle Aged;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","28","","32","IEEE","20 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time- and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call ‘non-homogeneous filter.’ We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERD/ERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis.

Research shows that around 20% of traffic accidents are closely related to driver fatigue. Therefore, establishing a reliable and accurate driver fatigue detection model is crucial to reducing traffic accidents and improving road safety. Physiological signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG) can more directly reflect the driver's physiological state, thus offering higher detection accuracy. However, most existing CNN-based methods focus only on single-scale EEG feature extraction, failing to capture fine-grained characteristics comprehensively. Moreover, many researchers concentrate only on single-channel EEG fatigue detection, which can lead to information loss or redundancy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) guided by a channel attention mechanism (CAM). The MSCNN captures multi-dimensional features of EEG signals, while the CAM explores channel contributions, emphasizing more valuable information to complement the MSCNN's performance. Our method achieves satisfactory results on the SADT public dataset, with an average accuracy of 79.62% across 11 subjects, outperforming other fatigue detection methods. This demonstrates that our model is effective in EEG-based driver fatigue detection.","","979-8-3503-6828-4","10.1109/ICHCI63580.2024.10807944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807944","EEG;Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network;Channel Attention Mechanism;Driver Fatigue Detection","Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Fatigue;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Physiology;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Vehicles;Accidents","","","","13","IEEE","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The impact of artifact reduction from EEG signals for the machine learningbased anxiety screening was investigated in this study. Here, the EEG data of 40 participants (aged between 18 and 25 years) was used; of these, 24 had anxiety and 16 did not. A novel algorithm for artifact removal was used to process the data.

In general, the training of the current subject's classification model can be aided by using labeled EEG samples from other subjects through transfer learning, thereby reducing or even eliminating calibration time. At present, most transfer learning algorithms applied in brain-computer interfaces still require a small number of labeled EEG samples from the current subject, and the classification accuracy is not high. The Riemannian space-based motor imagery EEG signal transfer learning fusion algorithm proposed in this paper does not require the current subject's labeled EEG samples and has a high classification accuracy. This algorithm adopts the covariance matrix as the EEG data characteristics, the source domain and target domain in Riemannian space alignment data distribution, through the joint distribution fit method to reduce the data distribution of the differences between different objects, and is suitable for the target domain classification model. Experimental results show that the algorithm can significantly improve the cross-session and cross-object classification accuracy of motor imagery EEG signals.","","978-1-6654-9563-9","10.1109/ICSIP55141.2022.9886924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9886924","motor-imagery;brain-computer interface;transfer learning;electroencephalography;Riemannian space","Training;Image processing;Transfer learning;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Data models","","2","","19","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, correlated noises in EEG measurements still constitute a significant challenge. Alternatively, building BCIs based on filtered brain activity source signals instead of using their surface projections, obtained from the noisy EEG signals, is a promising and not well-explored direction. In this context, finding the locations and waveforms of inner brain sources represents a crucial task for advancing source-based noninvasive BCI technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel multicore beamformer particle filter (multicore BPF) to estimate the EEG brain source spatial locations and their corresponding waveforms. In contrast to conventional (single-core) beamforming spatial filters, the developed multicore BPF considers explicitly temporal correlation among the estimated brain sources by suppressing activation from regions with interfering coherent sources. The hybrid multicore BPF brings together the advantages of both deterministic and Bayesian inverse problem algorithms in order to improve the estimation accuracy. It solves the brain activity localization problem without prior information about approximate areas of source locations. Moreover, the multicore BPF reduces the dimensionality of the problem to half compared with the PF solution, thus alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. The results, based on generated and real EEG data, show that the proposed framework recovers correctly the dominant sources of brain activity.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2413752","Operational Program Competitiveness Factors-Compete; National Funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(grant numbers:FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022682); U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:PEst-C/EEI/UI0127/2011); Bayesian Tracking and Reasoning over Time(grant numbers:EP/K021516/1); USA National Institute Of General Medical Sciences(grant numbers:R01GM096191); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061413","EEG inverse problem;spatial-temporal brain source localization;Bayesian estimation;particle filtering;multicore beamformer;Bayesian estimation;EEG inverse problem;multicore beamformer;particle filtering;spatial-temporal brain source localization","Electroencephalography;Brain models;Estimation;Position measurement;Noise measurement","Adult;Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Female;Humans;Male;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Visual Cortex;Young Adult","10","","52","CCBY","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characterizing neural activity during video game interaction allows for naturalistic and engaging brain dynamics research. Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors capture neural signals with high temporal resolution noninvasively, making them ideal for studying real-time brain activity during dynamic tasks like gaming. Understanding the complex dynamical phenomena of EEG patterns corresponding to different neural activities requires nonlinear analysis and feature extraction. Phase space reconstruction (PSR) is a typical nonlinear technique used to reveal the dynamics of the brain's neural system. Recently, topological signal processing (TSP) has been utilized to explore the properties of phase space, providing a powerful tool for analyzing the phase space. In this letter, a novel topological EEG nonlinear dynamics analysis approach is proposed using PSR techniques to convert EEG sensor signals into phase space, with the persistent homology tool employed to explore the topological properties of phase space. The proposed approach is implemented and experimentally validated on a publicly available EEG-based mobile brain–body imaging dataset. The framework demonstrates its efficacy in characterizing neural activity during game interaction with average accuracy of 90.31% for model 1 (TP9 and TP10) and 93.49% for model 2 (all four channels), outperforming existing deep learning approaches. This letter represents the first investigation into neural activity characterization-oriented EEG topological feature analysis, providing novel insights into the nonlinear dynamics analysis and feature extraction of the brain's neural system.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3488331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10738273","Sensor signal processing;electroencephalography (EEG);nonlinear dynamics;phase space reconstruction (PSR);topological data analysis (TDA)","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Neural activity;Point cloud compression;Video games;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Recording;Image reconstruction;Games","","3","","15","IEEE","30 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the specificity of EEG data, the same model has uneven learning effects on different subject features. The difference in learning effects means that training with only one model results in signals that are not correctly identified in some subjects, which is not conducive to the diffusion of motor imagery EEG signal classification techniques. During the study, we found that each subject data has a suitable model for it, and assigning a suitable model to the data for training can better ensure a better classification accuracy for each subject. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatic matching of motion imagery EEG signals with recognition models. This is a technique for extracting spatial features of motor imagery EEG signals based on graph convolution. Because the spatial features are highly stable and all time steps are included in the extraction of spatial features, the features extracted are macroscopic in nature. Based on the big data screening, we selected four excellent motor imagery EEG signal classification models and put the data of subjects who performed well on these models into the graph convolution model for supervised learning. The completed learning graph convolution model can be well trained to assign appropriate classical models of EEG signals to different subjects based on spatial features.

Assuming that there are EEG trials of motor-imagery tasks from multiple subjects available, we first select a subject whose EEG signal characteristics are similar to the target subject based on their power spectral density in resting-state EEG signals. We then use EEG signals of both the selected subject (called a source subject) and the target subject jointly in training a deep network. Rather than training a single path network, we adopt a multi-path network architecture, where the shared bottom layers are used to discover common features for both source and target subjects, while the upper layers branch out into (1) source-target subject identification, (2) label prediction optimized for a source subject, and (3) label prediction optimized for a target subject.

Methods: Inspired by the concept of cross-frequency coupling and its correlation with different behavioral tasks, this paper proposes a lightweight Interactive Frequency Convolutional Neural Network (IFNet) to explore cross-frequency interactions for enhancing representation of MI characteristics. IFNet first extracts spectro-spatial features in low and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then the interplay between the two bands is learned using an element-wise addition operation followed by temporal average pooling. Combined with repeated trial augmentation as a regularizer, IFNet yields spectro-spatio-temporally robust features for the final MI classification. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: the BCI competition IV 2a (BCIC-IV-2a) dataset and the OpenBMI dataset. Results: Compared with state-of-the-art MI decoding algorithms, IFNet achieves significantly superior classification performance on both datasets while improving the winner’s result in BCIC-IV-2a by 11%. Moreover, by conducting sensitivity analysis on decision windows, we show IFNet attains the best trade-off between decoding speed and accuracy. Detailed analysis and visualization verify IFNet can capture the coupling across frequency bands along with the known MI signatures. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IFNet for MI decoding.

While many factors influence the classification performance, an important aspect that is often ignored is the temporal dependency of these trial-EEG signals, in some cases impacted by interference of brain responses to consecutive target and non-target trials. In this study, the EEG signals are analyzed in a parametric sequence-based fashion, which considers all trials that induce brain responses in a rapid-sequence fashion, including a mixture of consecutive target and non-target trials. EEG signals are described as a linear combination of time-shifted cortical source activities plus measurement noise. Using a superposition of time invariant with an auto-regressive (AR) process, EEG signals are treated as a linear combination of a stationary Gaussian process and time-locked impulse responses to the stimulus (input events) onsets.

The results suggest that the proposed system is practicable, and can potentially help people better communicate with each other.","2577-1655","979-8-3503-3702-0","10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10394228","","Visualization;Brain;Anxiety disorders;Music;Human factors;Multiple signal classification;Cybernetics","","","","38","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, a Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm is studied, i.e., imagination of left-right hand movements. In this sense, a feature relevance analysis strategy is presented to select representing characteristics using a variability criterion. Besides, short-time parameters are estimated from EEG data by considering both time and time-frequency representations to deal with non-stationary dynamics. MIDRA is assessed on two different BCI databases, a well-known MI data and an Emotiv-based dataset. Attained results showed that MIDRA enhances the BCI system performance in comparison with benchmark methods by suitable ranking the input feature set.

The human brain is considered as a complex system having different mental states such as resting, active or cognitive states. It is a well-understood fact that the brain activity increases with the increased demand of cognition. The differences among different mental states can be explored by using classification techniques. The deep learning algorithm based on 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been proposed for the classification of rest and cognitive states and also the cognitive load has been assessed using brain waves particularly alpha wave. EEG data were collected from 34 human participants at resting and during learning state. After preprocessing, EEG data has been segmented into equal number of segments to investigate the deep temporal information for cognitive load assessment. The brain waves were extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for each segment and fed these segments to proposed model for classification and assessment of cognitive load. The results show that alpha brain wave produced consistent behavior using 1D-CNN technique for cognitive load measurement and provides efficient solution in EEG data for learning and resting state task.","","978-1-5386-9175-5","10.1109/SCORED.2018.8711150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711150","Resting states;Cognitive states;Brain waves;Feature extraction;1DCNN;Deep learning","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Deep learning;Discrete wavelet transforms;Biomedical monitoring;Load modeling","","20","","23","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most current studies choose filter cut-frequencies based on experience or intuition, resulting in sub-optimal use of MI-related spectral information in the electroencephalography (EEG). To improve information utilization, we propose a SincNet-based hybrid neural network (SHNN) for MI-based BCIs. First, raw EEG is segmented into different time windows and mapped into the CSP feature space. Then, SincNets are used as filter bank band-pass filters to automatically filter the data. Next, we used squeeze-and-excitation modules to learn a sparse representation of the filtered data. The resulting sparse data were fed into convolutional neural networks to learn deep feature representations. Finally, these deep features were fed into a gated recurrent unit module to seek sequential relations, and a fully connected layer was used for classification. We used the BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b to verify the effectiveness of our SHNN method. The mean classification accuracies (kappa values) of our SHNN method are 0.7426 (0.6648) on dataset 2a and 0.8349 (0.6697) on dataset 2b, respectively. The statistical test results demonstrate that our SHNN can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3156076","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2017YFB13003002); Grant National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573142,61773164); Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (the 111 Project)(grant numbers:B17017); Shuguang Project funded by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation(grant numbers:19SG25); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:14.756.31.0001); Polish National Science Center(grant numbers:UMO-2016/20/W/NZ4/00354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726162","Brain-computer interface;motor imagery;SincNet;neural network;gated recurrent unit","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Convolution;Kernel;Convolutional neural networks;Filter banks;Task analysis","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Neural Networks, Computer;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","53","","39","CCBY","2 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of this research program is to generate accurate and effective signals for non-invasive brain stimulation, and deliver a hardware prototype to monitor and treat motion related mental disease such as Parkinson's and Epilepsy. It was shown in previous research that Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals captured from brain activities demonstrate chaotic features. Artificial neural network (ANN) resembles brain biological neural network and can be used to simulate chaotic system. The trained ANN model can in turn be used to analyze and control brain activities. In order to investigate the chaotic phenomenons of EEG signals and develop function for automatic pattern recognition, large amount of EEG signals are required. However, EEG signals are prone to noise and the available data is very limited. It is possible to control and predict the time series outputs of chaotic systems with known equations. Therefore, in order to study the dynamic control of the brain neural networks, an ANN architecture is designed and optimized for implementing Lorenz attractor to simulate the chaotic states of EEG signals. The research includes chaotic system, ANN design and the optimization of ANN architecture, which is based on the consideration of hardware implementation. The designed ANN model is trained with Lorenz attractor outputs with a fixed set of system parameters and the optimized architecture is selected based on the training results of three training algorithms and 16 ANN architectures with different number of hidden neurons.","","978-1-5386-1030-5","10.1109/LSC.2017.8268138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268138","","Training;Neurons;Electroencephalography;Hardware;Topology;Biological neural networks;Training data","","18","","9","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autoregressive (AR) modes have previously been used to detect changes in the EEG signal. Based on the AR model parameters, an off-line distance measure called the Itakura distance (F. Itakura, 1975) has been used to effectively quantify changes in the EEG signal related to brain injury. The ordinary Itakura distance measure used for such quantification requires the same order for the AR models in all EEG segments. In this paper, a generalized Itakura distance measure is proposed without this constraint. The generalized measure is applied to the analysis of EEG signals. Preliminary results suggest that the generalized Itakura distance measure performs better for detecting injury-related changes in EEG.","1094-687X","0-7803-4262-3","10.1109/IEMBS.1997.757004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=757004","","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Biomedical measurements;Brain injuries;Signal processing;Frequency estimation;Speech;Biomedical engineering;Clinical diagnosis;Signal analysis","","1","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
