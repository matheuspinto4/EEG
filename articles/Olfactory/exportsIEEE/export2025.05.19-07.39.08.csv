Given the importance of detecting these early biomarkers for timely intervention, this letter proposes the novel use of chemosensory EEG for the early detection of PD, as it captures the brain's responses to olfactory stimuli, one of the primary sensory modalities affected by the disease. The proposed method employs an Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) to decompose EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Entropic features, including approximate entropy (AEn), sample entropy (SEn), and Rényi permutation entropy (RpEn), are extracted from these IMFs to identify distinguishing characteristics. These features are then evaluated using several machine learning classifiers. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that combining RpEn features with Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier achieves optimal performance, with an accuracy of 96.47%, a precision of 96.14%, and a kappa score of 0.95.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2025.3565312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979890","Parkinson's Disease;chemosensory EEG;olfactory dysfunction;ICEEMDAN;entropy features;machine learning","Electroencephalography;Entropy;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Diseases;Support vector machines;Random forests;Time series analysis;Complexity theory","","","","","IEEE","29 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

More recently, multisensory immersive experiences involving audio-visual-olfactory stimuli have been shown to lead to improved relaxation states. Despite these advances, very little is still known about the psychophysiological changes resulting from these interventions, and outcomes need to be monitored via questionnaires and interviews at the end of the intervention. In this article, we propose to instrument a VR headset with several biosensors to allow for the tracking of neural changes throughout the intervention, as well as track the progress of different neuromarkers, namely powers across the five conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency subbands computed at the frontal, central, parietal, and occipital areas of the brain. In total, 20 participants diagnosed with PTSD by their medical doctors took part in the experiment and underwent a 12-session multisensory nature immersion protocol. We show the changes that were observed for those who benefited and those who did not benefit from the intervention, leading to insights on potential new markers of intervention outcomes that could save patients and medical professionals time and resources. The proposed headset also allowed for changes in arousal states and EEG patterns to be tracked, thus providing additional insights on the disorder, as well as the effects of the intervention on patient symptoms.","2836-2071","","10.1109/JSAS.2025.3554131","NSERC Canada under their Discovery Grant program(grant numbers:RGPIN-2021-03246); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10938306","Electroencephalography;mental health;multisensory;olfactory;posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD);relaxation training;virtual reality (VR)","Electroencephalography;Headphones;Anxiety disorders;Protocols;Instruments;Resists;Particle measurements;Monitoring;Medical treatment;Medical diagnostic imaging","","","","54","CCBY","24 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Attention-Based Dense Spatial-Temporal Model (MSADM). This model leverages temporal attention, multi-scale dense feature extraction, and attention-based feature fusion to effectively capture and enhance the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies within EEG data, thereby improving the representations. Furthermore, we introduce a new olfactory-based emotion induction paradigm, which effectively mitigates the limitations of traditional visual and auditory stimuli by providing more stable and sustained emotional responses. We also present a novel EEG dataset involving 32 subjects, developed through a pilot study to select appropriate olfactory stimuli. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and emotion induction paradigm.

Based on the 2D Arousal-Valence model, we plot EEG and HRV data onto this model to visualize emotion changes caused by external stimuli. Using this proposed method, we conducted joint research with the home and personal care sector to evaluate emotional responses to aroma products, and with the automotive sector to assess drivers' emotional states. These studies demonstrate the value of academic research in guiding the industrial sector, particularly through emotion estimation based on EEG and HRV.

This study aims to delve into the neurophysiological dynamics of within-session attentional habituation and its correlation with Body Mass Index (BMI) concerning the repetition of high and low-calorie food, as well as non-food images. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured for both high and low BMI groups, as they repeatedly viewed the same food and non-food images. Analysis of ERPs on trial groups within each session revealed distinct effects of repeated image exposure on the brain’s attentional responses to food and non-food stimuli for both BMI groups. The result indicates that habituation effects and significance were observed in the parietal area of the brain for both BMI groups. Specifically, ERP responses to non-food image declined in motivation and attention over time, with significant changes observed within the 170-310 ms and 180-320 ms onset time windows for low and high BMI groups, respectively. However, no significant habituation effect was observed for both low/high caloric images in either BMI group. Additionally, ERP results indicated that high-calorie images exhibited a slower habituation rate, followed by low-calorie and non-food images across both BMI groups. In conclusion, this ERP study revealed that a habituation-like mechanism modulates attention towards repeated non-food images, while food images had a negligible effect in both groups. This suggests that the enhanced reward value associated with high-energy foods might lead to prolonged attention and diminished habituation, potentially contributing to obesity risks in individuals across different BMI groups.","","979-8-3503-8960-9","10.1109/ICDICI62993.2024.10810997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10810997","Body Mass Index (BMI);Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signal Processing;Event-Related Potential (ERP);Food Habituation;Repetition Visual Stimuli","Visualization;Body mass index;Obesity;Weight control;Image color analysis;Olfactory;Process control;Focusing;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography","","","","37","IEEE","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, in the present study participants were exposed to malodor of high and low intensity, with and without a pleasant masking stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) analyses have revealed that malodor masking induces significant modulations in cortical activity over frontal, central and parietal cortex, supported primarily by θ and β frequency band oscillations, which likely represent attention and affective neural processing, while also involving δ and α band oscillations. The findings pave the way for EEG-based detection of malodor suppression, which can support the design of effective olfactory masking techniques to combat odor annoyance in domestic and public environments.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781996","Olfaction;Malodor;Cognition;Brain;Electroencephalography","Neuroscience;Frequency modulation;Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Engineering in medicine and biology;Oscillators","Humans;Electroencephalography;Male;Adult;Odorants;Female;Wearable Electronic Devices;Young Adult;Brain;Smell","","","26","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the importance of addressing this issue, effective interventions to mitigate driver fatigue in the context of high-speed railway (HSR) systems remain a challenge. This study aims to examine the effects of three tactile intervention strategies [transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), thermal stimulation (TS), and vibration stimulation (VS)] on alleviating driver fatigue. A high-speed train simulator was used to conduct experiments with subjects. Each participant was required to complete four driving tasks: one without any intervention and three with each of the aforementioned tactile interventions when experiencing fatigue. Physiological metrics such as reaction time (RT), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) were collected to assess driver vigilance. The results revealed that thermal and VSs effectively reduced RTs (TS =1.11 s, VS =1.09 s, no-intervention =1.12 s) and slowed down the fatigue process. Drivers exhibited higher vigilance levels during these interventions, as reflected in improved ECG and EEG features. For example, the high-frequency energy of the EEG signal increases during the stimulation compared to before the stimulation. However, TEAS did not show significant effects on fatigue reduction. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidences to support that appropriate tactile interventions, particularly thermal and VSs, can effectively mitigate driver fatigue and improve vigilance levels. These findings offer practical insights for enhancing the safety of HSR operations by minimizing risks associated with driver fatigue.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3487844","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52072320); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:CSTB2023NSCQMSX0985); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742273","Driver fatigue;electrocardiogram (ECG);electroencephalogram (EEG);eye movement;tactile intervention;tactile sensors","Fatigue;Vehicles;Electroencephalography;Sensors;Vibrations;Visualization;Electrocardiography;Physiology;Olfactory;Roads","","1","","69","IEEE","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

TASA consists of a filter-bank layer, a spatial encoder, a time segmentation layer, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module, a multi-head self-attention (MSA) layer, and a fully connected layer. We improve upon the previous work by utilizing a two-phase learning framework, using the autoencoder module to learn the spatial information among electrodes by reconstructing the given input with a latent representation in the spatial dimension, which aims to minimize information loss compared to spatial filtering with CNN. The second improvement is inspired by the continuous nature of the olfactory process; we propose to use LSTM-MSA in TASA to capture its temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation among the time segments of the EEG. TASA is evaluated on an existing olfactory EEG dataset and compared with several existing deep learning architectures to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting olfactory-triggered emotional responses. Interpretability analyses with DeepLIFT also suggest that TASA learns spatial-spectral features that are relevant to olfactory-induced emotion recognition.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3399326","RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Fund, Singapore(grant numbers:A20G8b0102); Economic Development Board (EDB)-Wilmar Industrial Postgraduate Programme (IPP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528328","Deep learning;self-attention;electroencephalography;olfactory","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Long short term memory;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Odorants;Deep Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Attention;Male;Adult;Female;Smell;Young Adult","","","62","CCBYNCND","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we employ an olfactory video approach to evoke emotional expression more fully and acquire electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signal data. Second, the model makes full use of multimodal channel information, time-domain and spatial-domain information of EEG and EOG signals, captures the correlation of different channels using channel attention, and improves the accuracy of emotion recognition by focusing on the global dependence on the temporal order using the transformer. We conducted extensive experiments on the olfactory video sentiment dataset, and the experimental results were correct at 94.63%.

However, with the rise of virtual reality (VR) as a mood induction procedure (MIP), few studies have incorporated olfactory stimuli into emotion induction in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Considering the differences in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics between sensory stimuli, all previous two-dimensional (2D) and 3D emotional studies have been less effective in reality because they only use visual and audio senses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel EEG signal dataset based on OVR. We systematically analyzed the influence of olfactory stimuli on emotion induction in a VR environment from a neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, synchronous EEG signals were collected from 65 participants as they watched positive and negative videos in traditional VR and OVR. Their power spectral densities (PSDs) were then calculated to compare the differences in brain activation between their VR and OVR modes during the induction of positive and negative emotions, while their brain states were classified after feature selection. The results showed that olfactory stimuli enhanced EEG responses for positive emotions, but the opposite was true for negative emotions. Additionally, the recognition rate of brain emotional states was more than 90% under both positive and negative emotions, while the high-frequency β and γ bands could effectively distinguish VR and OVR modes. This study introduced the olfaction into the field of human-computer interaction, which could promote research on emotion induction and recognition in real-world environments.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2023.3337745","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872301,61472330); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335641","Electroencephalography (EEG);emotion induction;olfactory;olfactory-enhanced virtual reality","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Virtual reality;Videos;Three-dimensional displays;Brain;Limbic system","","2","","47","IEEE","29 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During biometric identification, expecting a person to be in a resting state, is not realistic; also external stimuli introduce artifacts in acquired EEG signals resulting in poor performance of EEG-based biometric systems. Odours evoke natural emotions in humans by associating strong memories with a particular smell. As a result, odours can be a potential stimulus for generating strong brainwaves; and unlike other triggers, odours can produce EEG without prominent artifacts. In this paper, an olfactory brainwave-based biometric system is proposed, where we model the subject-specific characteristics from the EEG signals captured using different odours as the trigger. We extract, from EEG signals, a set of handcrafted and diversified spectro-temporal features to train a biometric model. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset, show that it is possible to build an odour-independent biometric system with high-performance accuracy.

In the fruit fly olfactory system, the algorithm based on the “negative image” habituation model can filter redundant information and improve numerical stability. Inspired by the circuit mechanism, we propose a novel normalization method, habituation normalization (HN). HN first eliminates the “negative image” obtained by habituation and then calculates the statistics for normalizing. It solves the problem of accuracy degradation of BN when the batch size is small. Experiments show that HN can speed up neural network training and improve the model accuracy on vanilla LeNet-5, VGG16 and ResNet-50 in the Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Compared with four standard normalization methods, HN keeps stable and high accuracy in different batch sizes, which shows that HN has strong robustness, and is more suitable for neural network applications under limited computing power and memory.","","978-1-6654-9082-5","10.1109/ICICN56848.2022.10006573","Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006573","normalization;neural network training;resource constrained device;habituation;EEG signal application","Training;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Olfactory;Information filters;Generative adversarial networks;Stability analysis","","","","23","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe a developed instrumented VR headset capable of measuring electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electro-oculography (EOG) signals in real-time. From these signals, metrics of mental workload, engagement, and attention are extracted. We report changes seen in these behavioural measures between the two conditions, thus providing insights on factors driving the improved QoE seen with multisensory experiences.","","978-1-6654-8574-6","10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967498","Mental workload;immersive virtual reality;olfactory stimuli;haptic feedback","Headphones;Electrooculography;Instruments;Games;Electrocardiography;Particle measurements;Real-time systems","","4","","30","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the several factors that influence odor processing, their hedonic content and gender differences play a relevant role. Here, we investigated how these factors influence EEG effective connectivity among the mentioned brain regions during emotional olfactory stimuli. To this aim, we acquired EEG data from twenty-one healthy volunteers, during a passive odor task of odorants with different valence. We used Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for EEG and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) to investigate the modulatory effects of odors’ valence on the connectivity strengths of the PC-EC-OFC network. Moreover, we controlled for the influence of arousal and gender on such modulatory effects. Our results highlighted the relevant role of the forward and backward PC-EC connections in odor’s brain processing. On the one hand, the EC-to-PC connection was inhibited by both pleasant and unpleasant odors, but not by the neutral one. On the other hand, the PC-to-EC forward connection was found to be modulated (posterior probability (Pp)>0.95) by the arousal level associated with an unpleasant odor. Finally, the whole network dynamics showed several significant gender-related differences (Pp>0.95) suggesting a better ability in odor discrimination for the female gender.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3226207","European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 Project “POTION-Promoting Social Interaction through Emotional Body odors”(grant numbers:824153); Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) in the framework of the CrossLab Project (Departments of Excellence); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9968251","DCM;EEG;effective connectivity;gender;hedonic olfaction","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Gender issues;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Logic gates","","1","","104","CCBY","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the field of neural technologies, olfactory-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an approach that could be useful for neurorehabilitation of anosmia, dysosmia and hyposmia. While the idea of a BCI that decodes neural responses to different odors and/or enables odor-based neurofeedback is appealing, the results of previous EEG investigations into the olfactory domain are rather inconsistent, particularly when non-primary processing of olfactory signals is investigated. Here we report the results from an EEG study where an olfaction-based instructed-delay task was implemented. We utilized a modern olfactory display and a sensor of respiration to present odors in a strictly controlled fashion. Spatio-spectral EEG properties were analyzed to assess the olfactory-related components. Under these experimental conditions, EEG components representing processing of olfactory information were found around channel C4, where changes were detected for the 12-Hz spectral component. Additionally, significant differences in EEG patterns were observed when responses to odors were compared to the responses to odorless stimuli. We conclude EEG recordings are suitable for detecting active processing of odors. As such they could be integrated in a BCI that strives to rehabilitate olfactory disabilities or uses odors for hedonistic purposes.","","978-1-6654-6329-4","10.1109/CNN56452.2022.9912520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912520","neurofeedback;BCI;olfaction;EEG","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Recording;Task analysis;Neurotechnology;Neurofeedback","","1","","3","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since different frequency bands within the EEG signals contain different information, extracting specific frequency bands for classification performance is important. Moreover, due to the large inter-subject variability of the EEG signals, extracting frequency bands with subject-specific information rather than general information is crucial. Considering these, the focus of this letter is to classify the olfactory EEG signals by exploiting the spectral-domain information of specific frequency bands. In this letter, we present an olfactory EEG signal classification network based on frequency band feature extraction. A frequency band generator is first designed to extract frequency bands via the sliding window technique. Then, a frequency band attention mechanism is proposed to optimize frequency bands for a specific subject adaptively. Last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to extract the spatio-spectral information and predict the EEG category.

With virtual reality (VR), so-called human influential factors play a crucial role in the final perceived immersive media experience (IMEx). While two individuals can use the same VR headset, play the same game in the same location, and have the same goals, the two individuals can have very different experiences, with varying perceptions of immersion, presence, realism, engagement, and cybersickness. This can be particularly true in multisensory immersive experiences where, in addition to audio-visual stimuli, olfactory and haptic feedback can be used. In this paper, we describe a pilot study in which a VR game was developed to combine audio-visual, olfactory, and haptic feedback to the user in real-time. After game play, participants were asked about their IMEx using five scales: realism, immersion, presence, engagement, and overall quality of experience (QoE). Moreover, using an instrumented VR headset we measure electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electrooculography (EOG) signals and compute several instrumental measures of human influential factors, including an engagement index, arousal and valence indices, frontal alpha asymmetry, heart rate, several EEG sub-band powers, and eye blink rate. Using the subjective ratings, we measure the contribution that each IMEx subscale has on overall QoE, as a function of the type of sensory stimuli used. Results on 11 participants suggest very different contributions once smells and haptics are incorporated, relative to traditional audio-visual experiences. We also report on several instrumental measures that showed significant correlations with the IMEx subscales, suggesting that, in the future, real-time instrumental QoE measurement of multisensory experiences could be possible.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-8794-8","10.1109/QoMEX55416.2022.9900907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900907","Multisensory experience;olfaction;haptics;virtual reality;immersive media experience (IMEx)","Headphones;Atmospheric measurements;Instruments;Olfactory;Games;Particle measurements;Real-time systems","","5","","45","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A well-designed computational model that can correctly recognize preference induced by odor stimulation can be vital in the food and perfume industries.

In this study, we proposed a novel self-attention deep learning framework: Temporal Segment Attention Network (TESANet) to classify the brain state of subjects when they are exposed to pleasant and unpleasant odors. Odor stimulation is a continuous process, the temporal dynamics of the EEG signal should reflect the continuous changes of the brain responses to the given odor, thus we design the model to capture the intercorrelation between time segments of the EEG by utilizing the self-attention mechanism. TESANet consists of a filter-bank layer to extract spectral features, a spatial convolution layer to extract spatial features, a temporal segmentation layer to split the data into overlapping time windows, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to encode the temporal segments, a self-attention layer to decode the temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation between time segments, and finally a fully connected layer for classification.

Our analysis focused on beta band activity (13-30 Hz), which is known to facilitate integration of cortical areas involved in sensory perception. Higher-pleasantness stimuli induced elevated integration for the reward system, but not for the emotion and olfactory systems. Furthermore, the nodes of reward system showed more outward connections to the emotion and olfactory systems than inward connections from the respective systems. These results suggest the centrality of the reward system—supported by beta oscillations—in actively coordinating multi-system interactivity to give rise to hedonic experiences during olfactory perception.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629919","Olfactory perception;Community detection;Integration;Reward system;EEG","Measurement;Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Biology","Brain;Emotions;Odorants;Olfactory Perception;Smell","3","","24","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from healthy subjects performing a passive odor task of odorants with different valence. Once defined a fully-connected a priori network comprising the pyriform cortex (PC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and entorhinal cortex (EC), we tested the modulatory effect of odor valence on their causal interactions at the group level using the parametric empirical bayes (PEB) framework. Results show that both pleasant and the unpleasant odors have an inhibitory effect on the connection from EC to PC, whereas we did not observe any effect for the neutral odor. Moreover, the odor with positive valence has a stronger influence on connectivity dynamics compared to the negative odor.

Fragrance diffusers have been used as the potential appliance to reconcile mental conditions and achieve stress relief in daily life. Although perceiving fragrances are a complicated and subjective experience, studies have shown that it is possible to reveal the personal preference of fragrance from brain activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, using EEG to detect neural/mental states and apply them to human-machine interfaces has also been investigated for years. Therefore, this pilot study has two aims: (1) to identify users’ preference for fragrances from EEG; (2) to develop a personalized fragrance diffuser, Aroma Box, which can detect three mental states from EEG when a user feels depressed, stressed, or drowsily and then release fragrances in real-time to help user recover from the abnormal states. To achieve this goal, we first extracted the features and built a classifier to identify the user’s preference for fragrances from EEG. Then we calculated the indicators of brain states based on the EEG frequency analysis. Based on our preliminary experimental results, we deployed our algorithms in an in-house developed diffuser with a consumer 32-channel EEG headset, which has been further implemented in a real-life working environment and evaluated its efficacy by two users.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582446","National Cheng Kung University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582446","Olfactory perception;EEG;fragrance diffuser;brain-computer interface;human-computer interaction","Headphones;Electric potential;Conferences;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Regulation","","1","","26","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do this, a novel double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method is elaborately proposed. First, two square-based feature sets, each with N levels, are constructed based on N power-spectral-density (PSD) features extracted from N EEG electrodes. Subsequently, the electrode sequence (ES) codes are obtained by arranging the N feature values of each level of each square feature set in ascending order. Finally, inspired by the k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN), a minimum inconsistency classification is presented to find the odor concentration class whose ES codes are the least inconsistent with those of the testing sample. In the experiment, rose and rotten odors, each with five concentrations, were used to induce olfactory EEG signals on 13 participants. Experimental results reveal that, using the proposed DSES method, considerably high classification accuracies of 94.2% and 92.9% on five different concentrations of the rose and rotten odors were obtained, respectively, significantly outperforming ten other methods. These results verify the superiority of the proposed DSES method in identifying different odor concentrations. In addition, the EEG dataset with 4550 samples is made public through the website presented in this study. In this way, the proposed DSES method combined with the published EEG dataset may further promote the development of olfactory EEG recognition research.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3090177","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0306200); Tianjin Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:20JCZDJC00150,20JCYBJC00320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458278","Biological signal processing;double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method;odor concentration stimulation;olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG);power-spectral-density (PSD) feature","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Olfactory;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Learning systems","","4","","38","IEEE","17 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our results show that higher-pleasantness fragrances gave rise to right-Iateralized θ - γ coupling and left-lateralized α - γ coupling, which likely represent memory processing and emotional processing respectively. Regression models reveal that fragrance pleasantness exhibits a linear relationship with θ - γ laterality, but a nonlinear relationship with α - γ laterality.

A simple Normalization of data in the scale [0, 1] without attributing special importance to specific sub-intervals in [0, 1] results in significant loss in information, which cannot be retrieved otherwise to identify the proposer class of a given data point. This paper attempts to represent n-dimensional data point patterns into quantized fuzzy vectors of 3n dimensions. As the class information for all the data points of the training instances are known, a majority voting over (the individual quantized fuzzy) components of the data points in a class effectively returns an approximate centroidal measure of the data points lying in the same class. The concatenation of such majority-voted components of the data points in a class represents the class centroid of the respective class. The class centroids thus obtained are saved to determine the class of an unknown data point. The classification of an unknown data point here is performed in two steps. First the unknown data point is quantized in fuzzy space similarly as for the training data, and the resulting quantized fuzzy vector is projected along all the unit class centroid vectors of all known classes. In case the projection along the k-th unit class centroid vector is the largest, then the class of the unknown data point is regarded as k. The proposed principle has successfully been applied in classification of olfactory stimuli from the acquired EEG signals of the subjects and the classification performance is found to be superior with respect to the existing state-of-the art algorithms.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944662","Fuzzy vector quantization;olfactory perception;classification;electroencephalography","Training;Electroencephalography;Fuzzy sets;Vector quantization;Feature extraction;Olfactory","","2","","21","IEEE","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The achieved classification accuracy rate of 75.96% showed that peppermint-clove odor pair was the most discriminative. Based on the obtained results it is believed that this research has increased the variability of the scent-based experiment and greatly contributes to such studies for evaluating the function of the olfactory organ.","","978-1-5386-7893-0","10.1109/UBMK.2018.8566558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8566558","Olfactory;EEG;classification;peppermint;clove;thyme;rosemary.","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction","","1","","12","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A filter bank contains multiple band-pass filters is used to obtain EEG components from specific frequency ranges. Spatial subspace is constructed by exploring discriminative spatial components to enhance the spatial resolution of the EEG. Through the experiment, we confirm that brain signal can be identified in association with responses to pleasant and unpleasant odors, and there is a temporal pattern of such response because the temporal subspace optimization does improve the prediction result.

Neuromorphic computing is believed to allow real-time implementation of large scale spiking models for processing and computation in non-invasive BMIs.

Among those techniques, EEG is the most widely used one due to its portability, low setup cost, and noninvasiveness. Apart from other advantages, EEG signals also help to evaluate the ability of the smelling organ. In such studies, EEG signals, which are recorded during smelling, are analyzed to determine the subject lacks any smelling ability or to measure the response of the brain. The main idea of this study is to show the emotional difference in EEG signals during perception of valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater odors by the EEG gamma wave. The proposed method was applied to the EEG signals, which were taken from five healthy subjects in the conditions of eyes open and eyes closed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In order to represent the signals, we extracted features from the gamma band of the EEG trials by continuous wavelet transform with the selection of Morlet as a wavelet function. Then the -nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented as the classifier for recognizing the EEG trials as valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater. We achieved an average classification accuracy rate of 87.50% with the 4.3 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-open condition and an average classification accuracy rate of 94.12% with the 2.9 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-closed condition. The results prove that the proposed continuous wavelet transform–based feature extraction method has great potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during smelling of the present odors. It has been also established that gamma-band activity of the brain is highly associated with olfaction.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932904","","","","14","","","Traditional","23 May 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Prefrontal cortex is the prominent cortical structure to which the MDT is connected. Measuring stress, attention and drowsiness levels and developing proper courses of action to improve the performance and productivity is greatly facilitated by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG). Reading is one of the principal information acquisition methods for human brain. Cortical mapping plays a very important role in strengthening the memory circuit connections in the brain. While reading, if words are capable of evoking corresponding visuals, it will cause to the creation of long term memory. This is how mnemonics work excellently in enriching one's vocabulary. High Alpha and Beta band powers of EEG signals are responsible for scaling up relaxation and attention levels of an individual respectively. In this paper major focus is placed on how an olfactory stimulus alters the strength of beta band oscillations of the prefrontal cortex. Along with that we discuss the way fragrance nature of environment, incense burning and synthetic perfume, affects the relaxation levels (Alpha band power) and the attention levels (Beta band power) of a subject by collecting EEG signals from primary visual cortex during a reading task of four minutes. Alpha and Beta band powers are drastically low in case of synthetic perfume fragrance compared to incense burning ambience.","","978-1-5090-1746-1","10.1109/SPCOM.2016.7746640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746640","","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Visualization;Oscillators;Band-pass filters;Neurotransmitters;Central nervous system","","","","23","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Connectivity can be anatomical and functional properties of the brain. Nodes are voxels or Regions of Interest whereas edges are fibre bundles, temporal correlation between regions, in structural connectome and functional connectome respectively. This work focuses on functional connectivity analysis of brain network obtained through RS- fMRI images for identification of important regions in the human brain using image processing and graph theoretical approaches. The RS-fMRI images are obtained from 1000 Functional connectomes project and preprocessed using image processing techniques. Then the image is parcellated using AAL(Automated Anatomical Labeling) atlas and binary matrix is obtained. The graph is constructed from the derived matrix that exhibits functional connectivity between ROIs(Region of Interest). The various centrality measures (degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality) are used to identify the ROIs that act as provincial and/or connector hubs.

The design involves determining the weights of the selected recurrent dynamics so that for a given base stimulus, the dynamics converges to one of several optima (local attractors) on the given Lyapunov energy surface. Experiments undertaken reveal that for small noise amplitude below a selected threshold, the dynamics essentially converges to fixed stable attractor. However, with a slight increase in noise amplitude above the selected threshold, the local attractor of the dynamics shifts in the neighborhood of the attractor obtained for the noise-free standard stimuli. The other important issues undertaken in this paper include a novel algorithm for evolutionary feature selection and data-point reduction from multiple experimental EEG trials using principal component analysis. The confusion matrices constructed from experimental results show a marked improvement in classification accuracy in the presence of data point reduction algorithm. Statistical tests undertaken indicate that the proposed recurrent classifier outperforms its competitors with classification accuracy as the comparator. The importance of this paper is illustrated with a tea-taster selection problem, where an olfactory perceptual-ability measure is used to rank the tasters.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2014.2344003","University Grant Commission; Project: University with Potential for Excellence Program in Cognitive Science (Phase II); Jadavpur University; UGC, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879254","Data point reduction;EEG analysis;feature selection;olfactory perceptual ability;recurrent neural classifiers;Data point reduction;EEG analysis;feature selection;olfactory perceptual ability;recurrent neural classifiers","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Algorithm design and analysis","","54","","66","IEEE","15 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Re-exposure to olfactory cues during sleep triggers this reactivation and improves later recall performance. Here, we tested if the effects of odor-induced memory reactivations are odor-specific, that is, requiring the same odor during learning and subsequent sleep. We also tested whether odor-induced memory reactivation affects oscillatory EEG activity during sleep, as a putative mechanism underlying memory processing during sleep. Participants learned a visuospatial memory task under the presence of an odor. During subsequent SWS, the same odor, a different odor, or an odorless vehicle was presented. We found that odor re-exposure during sleep significantly improves memory only when the same odor was presented again, whereas exposure to a new odor or the odorless vehicle had no effect. The memory-enhancing effect of the congruent odor was accompanied by significant increases in frontal delta (1.5–4.5 Hz) and parietal fast spindle (13.0–15.0 Hz) power as well as by an increased negative-to-positive slope of the frontal slow oscillation. Our results indicate that odor-induced memory reactivations are odor specific and trigger changes in slow-wave and spindle power possibly reflecting a bottom–up influence of hippocampal memory replay on cortical slow oscillations as well as thalamo-cortical sleep spindles.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_00579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855426","","","","1","","","","17 Jul 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Although there are some EEG studies exploring the changes in the power of the brain oscillations during olfactory perception, they use simple power spectral analysis techniques and vary much in terms of the reported findings. To reduce this variability, we propose the use of multivariate spectral analysis, to reveal only the frequency patterns of the EEG signals that contribute the most to olfactory perception.

For example, over 250,000 brain cells are generated every minute in a two months old fetus. These cells slither across the brain, seeking out their proper destination, and then send out billions of axons, similarly to new branches of massive trees in a forest. The axons make connections with other brain cells, and a single neuron may have 100,000 connections with other neurons. This connection building phase is followed by a pruning phase. Many of these synapses will die (e.g. only half of the 200 billions generated neurons will survive to adulthood). If the pruning of the synapses is not efficient, then the aberrant connectivity can lead to diseases like schizophrenia. The second hypothetical mechanism underlying schizophrenia can be the low level of local connections between neurons (excessive synaptic pruning). This two hypotheses are investigated experimentally in this paper. In order to do this investigation, we simulate the brain biological system by introducing a neural network model that embeds two sub-systems (zones) within it. In this model, which tries to reproduce the piriform cortex, we perform changes to the number of connections (by increasing or decreasing them). By modifying the connectivity, we attempt to simulate the pruning process which may cause schizophrenia. The analyzed signals which describe these two zones are EEGs. We have investigated the level of chaos and the synchronization between these two zones. Both of these hypotheses have an impact on the level of chaos, but the excessive synaptic pruning hypothesis has a higher impact on the system dynamics regarding the nonlinear interdependence measure, than the insufficient pruning hypothesis","0840-7789","0-7803-8885-2","10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1557304","","Neurons;Biological system modeling;Brain modeling;Brain cells;Nerve fibers;Chaos;Fetus;Diseases;Biological systems;Biological neural networks","","","","14","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In line with previous experimental and compartmental work, 1) shock stimuli elicit EEG profiles with either isolated peaks or damped oscillations, the response type being determined by the intensity of the stimuli, and 2) temporally unpatterned input generates EEG oscillations supported by model-wide waves of excitation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.801986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028416","","Brain modeling;Large-scale systems;Neurons;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency;Electroencephalography;Biological system modeling;Aggregates;Artificial neural networks;Automata","Action Potentials;Cerebral Cortex;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Electromagnetic Fields;Electrophysiology;Humans;Interneurons;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Nerve Net;Neural Networks (Computer);Neurons;Olfactory Pathways;Pyramidal Cells;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","11","","34","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Olfactory EEG have revealed that oscillation and chaos play important roles in the processing of information in the bulb. We have based our model on coupled nonlinear oscillators, which resemble groups of mitral and granule cells as main building units. The model involves excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells, forming a non-linear oscillator. Several of these oscillators are coupled in a two layer architecture. The system exhibits complex oscillatory behavior, simulating the mammalian olfactory bulb. Results for two different types of input are considered. Simulations show that the dynamic behavior of the model is stable under the influence of noise. The model bulb responds to different odor input with spatio-temporal activation patterns, which are unique for each simulated odor. After inhalation has started, a burst of oscillatory activity emerges. The specific pattern of oscillation, which is exhibited by the bulb model, is coherent over the whole bulb.","1098-7576","0-7803-7044-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2001.939519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939519","","Brain modeling;Information processing;Olfactory;Neurons;Chaos;Oscillators;Biological system modeling;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Circuits;Feeds","","","","6","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The probability density function of the inter-spike intervals exhibits a Poisson-type behavior with a maximum located at time lags around 600 ms. Such a value agrees well with the frequency of the theta rhythm observed in the visual cortex of mammals, in particular, rabbits. EEGs were recorded from 8/spl times/8 arrays of subdural electrodes at high density (6/spl times/6 mm) in rabbits trained to discriminate visual stimuli in a classical aversive paradigm. EEG patterns had the form of amplitude and phase modulation of this. The covariance between the spatial events revealed striking peaks in the theta range (2-7 Hz), even when the autospectrum of the EEG failed to show a prominent peak. Comparable sequences of spatial EEG patterns in the olfactory system occur at frequencies in the theta range, reflecting the driving by respiration. These multiple sets of observation suggest that the visual system may be driven by surges of sensory input that are occasioned by saccades. Further studies are indicated to analyze this relationship by cross correlating simultaneous recordings of saccades and scalp EEGs from the occipital leads.","1098-7576","0-7803-7044-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2001.939517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939517","","Electroencephalography;Frequency;Rabbits;Humans;Probability density function;Rhythm;Electrodes;Phase modulation;Olfactory;Visual system","","2","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No one can justifiably claim that he or she has modeled brains, but they are a flowing spring of new concepts, and they provide a gold standard of what we can aspire to accomplish in developing more intelligent machines. The most fertile source of ideas with which to challenge and break the restrictions that characterize modern engineering practice is the electroencephalogram (EEG). It was the action potential of single neurons that provided the foundation of neurobiology for the 20th century, and in its time it supported the development of digital computers, neural networks, and computational neuroscience. Now in the 21st century, the EEG will lead us in a remarkably different direction of growth for the computing industry, which will be dominated by highly parallel, hierarchically organized, distributed analog machines. These devices now exist in prototype form. They feed on noise in support of chaotic attractor landscapes, which are shaped by reinforcement learning through self-governed experience, not training by 'teachers', and they may solve many of the problems of interfacing between finite state automata and the infinite complexity of the real world.","1098-7576","0-7803-7044-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2001.939470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939470","","Chaos;Electroencephalography;Computer networks;Brain modeling;Springs;Gold;Standards development;Machine intelligence;Neurons;Biological neural networks","","","","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is implemented in C to run on Macintosh, IBM, or UNIX platforms. The output can be set by parameter optimization to point, limit cycle, quasi-periodic, or aperiodic (presumably chaotic) attractors. The first three classes of solutions are stable under variations of parameters and perturbations by input, but they are biologically unrealistic. Chaotic solutions simulate the properties of time-dependent densities of olfactory action potentials and EEGs, but they transit into the basins of point, limit cycle, or quasi-periodic attractors after only a few seconds of simulated run time. Despite use of double precision arithmetic giving 64-bit words, the KIII model is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the terminal bit of parameters and inputs. The global stability decreases as the number of coupled oscillators in the OB is increased, indicating that attractor crowding reduces the size of basins in the model to the size of the digitizing step (/spl sim/10/sup -16/). Chaotic solutions having biological verisimilitude are robustly stabilized by introducing low-level, additive noise from a random number generator at two biologically determined points: rectified, spatially incoherent noise on each receptor input line, and spatially coherent noise to the AON, a global control point receiving centrifugal inputs from various parts of the forebrain. Methods are presented for evaluating global stability in the high dimensional system from measurements of multiple chaotic outputs. Ranges of stability are shown for variations of connection weights (gains) in the KIII model. The system is devised for pattern classification.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.633888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=633888","","Chaos;Brain modeling;Olfactory;Biological system modeling;Oscillators;Stability;Additive noise;Limit-cycles;Noise generators;Negative feedback","","62","","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time-frequency (TF) methods, which quantify the spectral content of the EEG as a function of time, are well suited as tools for the study of spontaneous and induced changes in oscillatory states. The use of these methods provides insights into the temporal dynamics of EEG activity in both humans and experimental animals, and aids the study of the neuronal mechanisms that generate rhythmic EEG activity. Further the use of TF coherence analysts, which quantifies the consistency of phase relationships in multichannel EEG recordings, may contribute to the understanding of signal transmission between neuronal populations in different parts of the brain. We have used TF techniques to analyze the flow of activity patterns between two strongly connected brain structures: the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. Both of these structures are believed to be involved in information storage. By applying various frequencies of stimulation, we have found a peak in the spectral power in both sites at around 18 Hz, but the coherence between the EEG signals recorded from these sites was found to increase monotonically up to about 35 Hz. We have also found that long-term potentiation, a strong increase in the efficacy of excitatory synapses between these sites, either had no effect or decreased coherence.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.535247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535247","","Monitoring;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Time frequency analysis;Humans;Animals;Signal analysis;Pattern analysis;Brain;Hippocampus","","28","","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metabolic energy is provided by neurons, which are not like transistors, in that they require continuous chaotic activity to survive. Properties on which brain function is based include capacities continually to construct patterns from chaotic dynamics, to build a broad knowledge base by Hebbian learning, and to change the base rapidly when global adaptation is required.

Oscillations and chaos are present in both biological and artificial neurons. A single biological neuron has an oscillatory dynamics, and can generate chaos. At a macroscopic level however, chaos is not created by the dynamics of individual neurons, but by the interaction of large groups of neurons. These macroscopic oscillations are measured by EEG recordings that indicate the presence of chaotic attractors in the brain. Also in the visual cortex, neurons have been found to oscillate in a coherent way depending on the global stimulus. On the other hand, as recurrent artificial neural networks are non linear dynamical systems, it is possible to get different behaviours by adjusting their parameters: convergence toward equilibrium points, toward periodic solutions or chaotic trajectories. In this case, the study of oscillations is more a scientific activity than a goal for storing and processing information. In this paper, however, we explore the possibilities to make use of chaos for information storage.<>","","0-7803-2070-0","10.1109/CNNA.1994.381695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=381695","","Tutorial;Information processing;Neurons;Associative memory;Chaos;Circuits;DH-HEMTs;Paper technology;Electroencephalography;Olfactory","","6","1","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
