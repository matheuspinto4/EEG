The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were processed to extract time-domain, spectral-domain, and nonlinear features, which were subsequently classified using various machine learning algorithms. The classification outcomes were mapped onto a two-dimensional pleasure-arousal plane, with the Medium Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) achieving the highest performance, including $99.8 \%$ validation accuracy and $100 \%$ test accuracy.

Since different frequency bands within the EEG signals contain different information, extracting specific frequency bands for classification performance is important. Moreover, due to the large inter-subject variability of the EEG signals, extracting frequency bands with subject-specific information rather than general information is crucial. Considering these, the focus of this letter is to classify the olfactory EEG signals by exploiting the spectral-domain information of specific frequency bands. In this letter, we present an olfactory EEG signal classification network based on frequency band feature extraction. A frequency band generator is first designed to extract frequency bands via the sliding window technique. Then, a frequency band attention mechanism is proposed to optimize frequency bands for a specific subject adaptively. Last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to extract the spatio-spectral information and predict the EEG category. Comparison experiment results reveal that the proposed method outperforms a series of baseline methods in terms of both classification quality and inter-subject robustness.

A well-designed computational model that can correctly recognize preference induced by odor stimulation can be vital in the food and perfume industries. Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to study the brain's response to odor stimulation due to its good temporal resolution and low acquisition cost. In this study, we proposed a novel self-attention deep learning framework: Temporal Segment Attention Network (TESANet) to classify the brain state of subjects when they are exposed to pleasant and unpleasant odors. Odor stimulation is a continuous process, the temporal dynamics of the EEG signal should reflect the continuous changes of the brain responses to the given odor, thus we design the model to capture the intercorrelation between time segments of the EEG by utilizing the self-attention mechanism. TESANet consists of a filter-bank layer to extract spectral features, a spatial convolution layer to extract spatial features, a temporal segmentation layer to split the data into overlapping time windows, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to encode the temporal segments, a self-attention layer to decode the temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation between time segments, and finally a fully connected layer for classification.

A patient often is not able to comprehend the loss of olfactory perception in the early stages of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. In order to identify olfactory sensory loss early, deep learning frameworks can be very useful. The main objective of our study is to build a deep learning-based model for classifying five different aromatic stimuli, i.e., no smell, rose water's smell, perfume's smell, cinnamon's smell, and odonil's smell using the EEG signals of subjects. In this paper, an Attention mechanism-based 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture has been introduced. The designed model successfully classified five types of olfactory stimuli using EEG signals with 97.92% accuracy.

To do this, a novel double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method is elaborately proposed. First, two square-based feature sets, each with N levels, are constructed based on N power-spectral-density (PSD) features extracted from N EEG electrodes. Subsequently, the electrode sequence (ES) codes are obtained by arranging the N feature values of each level of each square feature set in ascending order. Finally, inspired by the k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN), a minimum inconsistency classification is presented to find the odor concentration class whose ES codes are the least inconsistent with those of the testing sample. In the experiment, rose and rotten odors, each with five concentrations, were used to induce olfactory EEG signals on 13 participants. Experimental results reveal that, using the proposed DSES method, considerably high classification accuracies of 94.2% and 92.9% on five different concentrations of the rose and rotten odors were obtained, respectively, significantly outperforming ten other methods. These results verify the superiority of the proposed DSES method in identifying different odor concentrations. In addition, the EEG dataset with 4550 samples is made public through the website presented in this study. In this way, the proposed DSES method combined with the published EEG dataset may further promote the development of olfactory EEG recognition research.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3090177","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0306200); Tianjin Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:20JCZDJC00150,20JCYBJC00320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458278","Biological signal processing;double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method;odor concentration stimulation;olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG);power-spectral-density (PSD) feature","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Olfactory;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Learning systems","","4","","38","IEEE","17 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike other senses, smell works through the molecules of olfactory stimuli acting on the human nervous system to elicit psychological effects, which is difficult to be accurately described and measured. This makes the commonly used methods hardly applicable to olfactory affective computation. Through analysis of the neural mechanism of human emotions evoked by olfactory sense, this paper specifically designed an EEG experiment to obtain the neural activity data of olfactory stimuli, and compares the clustering characteristics of neural feature data with self-reported scores in PAD emotional space. Thereout, the LS-SVR estimator based on the feature parameters extracted from EEG signal data is proposed for olfactory affective computation. It shows better distinguishing performance and potential reliability than self-reported data, and thus provides an enlightening exploration of this issue.","2329-6259","978-1-6654-2655-8","10.1109/PIC53636.2021.9687068","Ministry of Education; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687068","affective computation;olfactory emotion;EEG signal;clustering analysis;LS-SVR estimator","Mood;Conferences;Olfactory;Neural activity;Feature extraction;Nervous system;Electroencephalography","","2","","24","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EEG signals analyzed in this research are based on taste, odor, and motor imagery, employing novel methods to interpret these complex signals accurately. Three datasets were used in this study: taste-based EEG signals from 10 healthy subjects, odor-based EEG signals from 5 subjects, and motor imagery EEG data from 29 subjects. Feature extraction methods such as Hilbert Transform (HT) for taste, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) for odor, and HT for motor imagery were applied. Sequential forward and backward search methods were compared with a newly proposed Random Subset Channel Selection (RSCS) method to determine the most effective channels. For the taste dataset, using the RSCS method, an average classification accuracy of 82% was achieved with a significant reduction in the number of channels, demonstrating a 37.9% improvement over using all channels. In the odor dataset, the proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 99.28% for open-nose conditions and 97.49% for closed-nose conditions, with an 86.3% improvement in classification accuracy and an 89.09% reduction in computational complexity. The RSCS method achieved an average accuracy of 81.56% for the motor imagery dataset, showing superior performance compared to sequential methods. The proposed RSCS method outperforms traditional sequential methods by improving classification accuracy and reducing computational complexity across different types of EEG datasets. This method holds promise for enhancing BCI system performance, significantly improving the detection and early diagnosis of neurological conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3473810","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TUBITAK)(grant numbers:118E241); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10704658","Brain-computer interface;classification accuracy;computational complexity;EEG;feature extraction;random subset channel selection","Electroencephalography;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Motors;Wavelet transforms;Transforms;Convolutional neural networks;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Continuous wavelet transforms;Brain-computer interfaces;Computational complexity","","","","56","CCBYNCND","3 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design involves determining the weights of the selected recurrent dynamics so that for a given base stimulus, the dynamics converges to one of several optima (local attractors) on the given Lyapunov energy surface. Experiments undertaken reveal that for small noise amplitude below a selected threshold, the dynamics essentially converges to fixed stable attractor. However, with a slight increase in noise amplitude above the selected threshold, the local attractor of the dynamics shifts in the neighborhood of the attractor obtained for the noise-free standard stimuli. The other important issues undertaken in this paper include a novel algorithm for evolutionary feature selection and data-point reduction from multiple experimental EEG trials using principal component analysis. The confusion matrices constructed from experimental results show a marked improvement in classification accuracy in the presence of data point reduction algorithm.

However, with the rise of virtual reality (VR) as a mood induction procedure (MIP), few studies have incorporated olfactory stimuli into emotion induction in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Considering the differences in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics between sensory stimuli, all previous two-dimensional (2D) and 3D emotional studies have been less effective in reality because they only use visual and audio senses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel EEG signal dataset based on OVR. We systematically analyzed the influence of olfactory stimuli on emotion induction in a VR environment from a neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, synchronous EEG signals were collected from 65 participants as they watched positive and negative videos in traditional VR and OVR. Their power spectral densities (PSDs) were then calculated to compare the differences in brain activation between their VR and OVR modes during the induction of positive and negative emotions, while their brain states were classified after feature selection. The results showed that olfactory stimuli enhanced EEG responses for positive emotions, but the opposite was true for negative emotions. Additionally, the recognition rate of brain emotional states was more than 90% under both positive and negative emotions, while the high-frequency β and γ bands could effectively distinguish VR and OVR modes. This study introduced the olfaction into the field of human-computer interaction, which could promote research on emotion induction and recognition in real-world environments.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2023.3337745","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872301,61472330); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335641","Electroencephalography (EEG);emotion induction;olfactory;olfactory-enhanced virtual reality","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Virtual reality;Videos;Three-dimensional displays;Brain;Limbic system","","2","","47","IEEE","29 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In section 2, KIII model is introduced briefly. The structure of the KIII model is similar to that of olfactory neural systems. The model of neurons is based on the real action of neurons with the stimulus and optimized according to mathematical optimization. In section 3, KIII model was used as a classifier and the performance of the KIII model was evaluated to identify epileptic EEG. In the first group of experiments, the features are extracted based on EMD and the recognition rate of the KIII model is over 91 % with few training times. In the second group of experiments, extracting the feature of EEG is unnecessary and the raw EEG signals are used as the input directly. The KIII model gives the better recognition rate over 96 %. Experimental results show that KIII model has remarkable characteristics: (1) KIII model can learn the pattern with few training times, which is different from general deep learning models; (2) KIII model can recognize raw signals without special feature-extracting process, which is similar with deep learning model; (3) the structure of KIII model is very similar to that of real olfactory neural systems, which is partly similar with deep learning model.","","978-1-5386-8097-1","10.1109/FSKD.2018.8687226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687226","Olfactory neural system;EEG recognition;KIII model","","","","","15","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simple Normalization of data in the scale [0, 1] without attributing special importance to specific sub-intervals in [0, 1] results in significant loss in information, which cannot be retrieved otherwise to identify the proposer class of a given data point. This paper attempts to represent n-dimensional data point patterns into quantized fuzzy vectors of 3n dimensions. As the class information for all the data points of the training instances are known, a majority voting over (the individual quantized fuzzy) components of the data points in a class effectively returns an approximate centroidal measure of the data points lying in the same class. The concatenation of such majority-voted components of the data points in a class represents the class centroid of the respective class. The class centroids thus obtained are saved to determine the class of an unknown data point. The classification of an unknown data point here is performed in two steps. First the unknown data point is quantized in fuzzy space similarly as for the training data, and the resulting quantized fuzzy vector is projected along all the unit class centroid vectors of all known classes. In case the projection along the k-th unit class centroid vector is the largest, then the class of the unknown data point is regarded as k. The proposed principle has successfully been applied in classification of olfactory stimuli from the acquired EEG signals of the subjects and the classification performance is found to be superior with respect to the existing state-of-the art algorithms.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944662","Fuzzy vector quantization;olfactory perception;classification;electroencephalography","Training;Electroencephalography;Fuzzy sets;Vector quantization;Feature extraction;Olfactory","","2","","21","IEEE","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, it has not been exactly proved how the human brain gives response to different odors because of the limited kind of odor usage and different kinds of proposed methods. The present study demonstrates the effect of lotus flower and cheese odors on EEG signals, which were recorded from 5 healthy subjects at the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we categorized the EEG trials into two classes between lotus flower and cheese odors. In order to represent the EEG trials, we extracted features by using Wavelet Transform coefficients. As wavelet function, we tested five kinds of wavelets including Morlet, Mexican, Meyer, Coiflet and Daubechies on delta, theta, alpha, beta, whole band of the EEG signal. The extracted features were classified by k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The achieved results showed that among the tested wavelet functions, Mexican wavelet has a great potential to represent the EEG signals which were recorded during smelling of lotus flower and cheese odors under the eyes open and eyes closed conditions.

EEG can be acquired, when the subject is exposed to external stimuli such as visual triggers or when the subject is resting. During biometric identification, expecting a person to be in a resting state, is not realistic; also external stimuli introduce artifacts in acquired EEG signals resulting in poor performance of EEG-based biometric systems. Odours evoke natural emotions in humans by associating strong memories with a particular smell. As a result, odours can be a potential stimulus for generating strong brainwaves; and unlike other triggers, odours can produce EEG without prominent artifacts. In this paper, an olfactory brainwave-based biometric system is proposed, where we model the subject-specific characteristics from the EEG signals captured using different odours as the trigger. We extract, from EEG signals, a set of handcrafted and diversified spectro-temporal features to train a biometric model. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset, show that it is possible to build an odour-independent biometric system with high-performance accuracy. Additionally, using odour-chemistry literature, we show that a small set of carefully chosen odours are sufficient to build a high-performance biometric system.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9360-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO58844.2023.10290059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290059","EEG Biometry;Subject Identification;EEG;Ol-factory brainwaves;Odour Stimulus","Visualization;Biometrics (access control);Biological system modeling;Olfactory;External stimuli;Signal processing;Brain modeling","","","","37","","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Attention-Based Dense Spatial-Temporal Model (MSADM). This model leverages temporal attention, multi-scale dense feature extraction, and attention-based feature fusion to effectively capture and enhance the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies within EEG data, thereby improving the representations. Furthermore, we introduce a new olfactory-based emotion induction paradigm, which effectively mitigates the limitations of traditional visual and auditory stimuli by providing more stable and sustained emotional responses. We also present a novel EEG dataset involving 32 subjects, developed through a pilot study to select appropriate olfactory stimuli. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and emotion induction paradigm.

The high temporal resolution and non-invasiveness of Electroencephalogram (EEG) make it suitable to objectively study human preferences for odors. Effectively learning the temporal dynamics and spatial information from EEG is crucial for detecting odor-induced emotional valence. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture called Temporal Attention with Spatial Autoencoder Network (TASA) for predicting odor-induced emotions using EEG. TASA consists of a filter-bank layer, a spatial encoder, a time segmentation layer, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module, a multi-head self-attention (MSA) layer, and a fully connected layer. We improve upon the previous work by utilizing a two-phase learning framework, using the autoencoder module to learn the spatial information among electrodes by reconstructing the given input with a latent representation in the spatial dimension, which aims to minimize information loss compared to spatial filtering with CNN. The second improvement is inspired by the continuous nature of the olfactory process; we propose to use LSTM-MSA in TASA to capture its temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation among the time segments of the EEG. TASA is evaluated on an existing olfactory EEG dataset and compared with several existing deep learning architectures to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting olfactory-triggered emotional responses. Interpretability analyses with DeepLIFT also suggest that TASA learns spatial-spectral features that are relevant to olfactory-induced emotion recognition.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3399326","RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Fund, Singapore(grant numbers:A20G8b0102); Economic Development Board (EDB)-Wilmar Industrial Postgraduate Programme (IPP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528328","Deep learning;self-attention;electroencephalography;olfactory","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Long short term memory;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Odorants;Deep Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Attention;Male;Adult;Female;Smell;Young Adult","","","62","CCBYNCND","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fragrance diffusers have been used as the potential appliance to reconcile mental conditions and achieve stress relief in daily life. Although perceiving fragrances are a complicated and subjective experience, studies have shown that it is possible to reveal the personal preference of fragrance from brain activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, using EEG to detect neural/mental states and apply them to human-machine interfaces has also been investigated for years. Therefore, this pilot study has two aims: (1) to identify users’ preference for fragrances from EEG; (2) to develop a personalized fragrance diffuser, Aroma Box, which can detect three mental states from EEG when a user feels depressed, stressed, or drowsily and then release fragrances in real-time to help user recover from the abnormal states. To achieve this goal, we first extracted the features and built a classifier to identify the user’s preference for fragrances from EEG. Then we calculated the indicators of brain states based on the EEG frequency analysis. Based on our preliminary experimental results, we deployed our algorithms in an in-house developed diffuser with a consumer 32-channel EEG headset, which has been further implemented in a real-life working environment and evaluated its efficacy by two users.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582446","National Cheng Kung University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582446","Olfactory perception;EEG;fragrance diffuser;brain-computer interface;human-computer interaction","Headphones;Electric potential;Conferences;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Regulation","","1","","26","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effects of odor stimuli, which has complex structure, on central nerveous system is lack of knowledge in literature. The goal of proposed study is to show how pleasant-unpleasant odors effect brain waves by using spectral analysis methods and discriminating different odors through statistical methods and a classifier. The EEG dataset used in study was taken from 6 participants while their eyes are closed and 4 odor (2 pleasant-2unpleasant) stimulus were applied to them using 14 chanelled EMOTIV-EPOC headset. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was used to pre-processed signals obtained from embedded filters to extract more meaningful EEG sub-bands (delta-tetha-alpha-beta). First of all, power spectrum graphics of these sub-bands was drawn using Welch's method to see how pleasant-unpleasant odor EEGs behave. Then, spectrum coefficients were gained by help of parametric (Burg, Yule-Walker, Covariance, Modified Covariance) and non-parametric (Welch's) methods. Selected feature vectors from these coefficients were classified. Selected features are min, max value and standard deviation. k-NN was chosen for classification algorithm. Avarage power spectrum analysis showed that unpleasant odor EEG has higher values than pleasant one with respect to all sub-bands. Parametric methods gave better results to discriminate odor EEGs.

The differential entropy (DE) feature and four classifiers were employed to test the efficiency of emotion recognition. The best average accuracies of the OVEP, OVLP, TVEP, and TVLP were 50.54%, 51.49%, 40.22%, and 57.55%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the OVEP significantly outperformed the TVEP on classification performance, while there was no significant difference between the OVLP and TVLP. Besides, olfactory-enhanced videos achieved higher efficiency in evoking negative emotions than traditional videos.

Among those techniques, EEG is the most widely used one due to its portability, low setup cost, and noninvasiveness. Apart from other advantages, EEG signals also help to evaluate the ability of the smelling organ. In such studies, EEG signals, which are recorded during smelling, are analyzed to determine the subject lacks any smelling ability or to measure the response of the brain. The main idea of this study is to show the emotional difference in EEG signals during perception of valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater odors by the EEG gamma wave. The proposed method was applied to the EEG signals, which were taken from five healthy subjects in the conditions of eyes open and eyes closed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In order to represent the signals, we extracted features from the gamma band of the EEG trials by continuous wavelet transform with the selection of Morlet as a wavelet function. Then the -nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented as the classifier for recognizing the EEG trials as valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater. We achieved an average classification accuracy rate of 87.50% with the 4.3 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-open condition and an average classification accuracy rate of 94.12% with the 2.9 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-closed condition. The results prove that the proposed continuous wavelet transform–based feature extraction method has great potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during smelling of the present odors. It has been also established that gamma-band activity of the brain is highly associated with olfaction.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932904","","","","14","","","Traditional","23 May 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Recent research has demonstrated that multimodal interchannel correlations and insufficient emotion elicitation plague deep learning-based emotion identification techniques. To cope with these problems, we propose a multimodal and channel attention fusion transformer (MCAF-Transformer). First, we employ an olfactory video approach to evoke emotional expression more fully and acquire electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signal data. Second, the model makes full use of multimodal channel information, time-domain and spatial-domain information of EEG and EOG signals, captures the correlation of different channels using channel attention, and improves the accuracy of emotion recognition by focusing on the global dependence on the temporal order using the transformer. We conducted extensive experiments on the olfactory video sentiment dataset, and the experimental results were correct at 94.63%. The results show that olfactory videos evoke emotion more adequately than pure videos and that the MCAF-Transformer model significantly outperforms other emotion recognition methods.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3370813","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972437); Distinguish Youth Foundation of Anhui Scientific Committee(grant numbers:2208085J05); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Flight Techniques and Flight Safety, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)(grant numbers:FZ2022KF15); Special Fund for Key Program of Science and Technology of Anhui Province(grant numbers:202203a07020008); Cloud Ginger XR-1 Platform; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10445754","Attention mechanisms;electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG);multimodal;olfactory video emotion evocation;transformer","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Emotion recognition;Brain modeling;Transformers;Electrooculography;Time-domain analysis","","","","45","IEEE","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, on resource-constrained devices, BN cannot effectively estimate the mean and the variance of samples when training/fine-tuning with small batches of data, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the neural network. In the fruit fly olfactory system, the algorithm based on the “negative image” habituation model can filter redundant information and improve numerical stability. Inspired by the circuit mechanism, we propose a novel normalization method, habituation normalization (HN). HN first eliminates the “negative image” obtained by habituation and then calculates the statistics for normalizing. It solves the problem of accuracy degradation of BN when the batch size is small. Experiments show that HN can speed up neural network training and improve the model accuracy on vanilla LeNet-5, VGG16 and ResNet-50 in the Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Compared with four standard normalization methods, HN keeps stable and high accuracy in different batch sizes, which shows that HN has strong robustness, and is more suitable for neural network applications under limited computing power and memory.","","978-1-6654-9082-5","10.1109/ICICN56848.2022.10006573","Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006573","normalization;neural network training;resource constrained device;habituation;EEG signal application","Training;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Olfactory;Information filters;Generative adversarial networks;Stability analysis","","","","23","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system allows you to create complex stimuli for the perception that the subject uses a visual, acoustic or olfactory system. For registration of biological signals earmarked voice recording and electroencephalogram (EEG). Since stimulus material acts on three different channels of human perception, in the biotechnical system includes means of visual, audio-visual and olfactory stimulation. All system components are integrated into the control unit shown in the form of a personal computer with pre-installed special software. A feature of the system work scenario is the registration sample speech only after the marked changes in the electroencephalogram caused by the perception of the appropriate stimulus. This approach increases the credibility of the sampling of speech, which can then be used to form the rules of recognition of types of emotions. With this system were formed multimodal database comprising 280 different russian speakers phrases and corresponding EEG recording. The goals of experiments are studies attribute spaces are invariant to the physical nature of the signal and adequately reflects the emotional response of the subject, and testing the hypothesis of invariance of attributes allocated to the national characteristics of speech signals. In order to study the dynamics of emotional response developed a method that allows to explore a variety of discrete portions of biological signals. The technique is based on the idea of shifting the window, which is carried out static analysis. For each window are used as classical methods of calculation of the spectrum of the signal, and the methods of nonlinear dynamics. System showed enough high accuracy interpreting both the EEG pattern (83%) and with the speech samples (96 %) of the multimodal base emotions and objects taken from German base Emo-DB (92%).

With approximately hundred billion neurons, brain transforms a variety of inputs such as thought, feeling, sound and odor into a physical or emotional response. A way to measure the response of the brain into such inputs is analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this work, the EEG signals, which were recorded during smelling of cheese and rosewater odors, are analyzed and classified based on features which were extracted using autoregressive model. EEG signals were taken from 5 healthy subjects in the cases of eyes open and eyes closed at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. By using k-nearest neighbor classifier, we obtained a mean classification accuracy rate of 96.21 % for the subjects at eyes closed case and a mean classification accuracy rate of 72.24 % for the subjects at eyes open case. The obtained results prove that the proposed method have great potential for classifying the EEG signals recorded during smelling of cheese and rosewater odors and instead of using subject-specific model it can be applied to all subjects.","","978-1-5090-1679-2","10.1109/SIU.2016.7495935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495935","electroencephalogram;brain;odor;cheese;rosewater;classification","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Dairy products;Feature extraction;Analytical models;Neuroscience;Complex systems","","","","","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, to improve the use of limited odor types, EEG data recorded during the smelling of 4 natural oils (mint, clove, thyme, rosemary) obtained by one %100 cold printing were used. After the EEG data set recorded from 3 subjects are preprocessed with unit change or minimum-maximum normalization, statistically based features were extracted from the signal.

Oscillations and chaos are present in both biological and artificial neurons. A single biological neuron has an oscillatory dynamics, and can generate chaos. At a macroscopic level however, chaos is not created by the dynamics of individual neurons, but by the interaction of large groups of neurons. These macroscopic oscillations are measured by EEG recordings that indicate the presence of chaotic attractors in the brain. Also in the visual cortex, neurons have been found to oscillate in a coherent way depending on the global stimulus. On the other hand, as recurrent artificial neural networks are non linear dynamical systems, it is possible to get different behaviours by adjusting their parameters: convergence toward equilibrium points, toward periodic solutions or chaotic trajectories. In this case, the study of oscillations is more a scientific activity than a goal for storing and processing information. In this paper, however, we explore the possibilities to make use of chaos for information storage.<>","","0-7803-2070-0","10.1109/CNNA.1994.381695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=381695","","Tutorial;Information processing;Neurons;Associative memory;Chaos;Circuits;DH-HEMTs;Paper technology;Electroencephalography;Olfactory","","6","1","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
