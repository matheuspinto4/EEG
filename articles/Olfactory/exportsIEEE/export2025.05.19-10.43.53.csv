However, there still need to study the encoding mechanism and perception mechanism of olfactory information in the olfactory system. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an effective olfactory model. Most studies have focused on changes in one part of the olfactory system, but the connections between parts of the olfactory system also need to be studied, especially the neural connections and coding mechanisms between the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. For co-culture techniques can nearly mimic the in vivo environment, which has made it possible to study interactions between neurons and to reproduce complex neural circuits in vitro. Here, a co-culture olfactory system model was established based on Transwell microporous membrane. Neural connections were established by culturing OE organoids and OB neuronal network on both sides of the membrane to simulate the olfactory system. This model provides a promising tool for exploring the molecular mechanism of olfactory perception and information encoding.","","979-8-3503-4865-1","10.1109/ISOEN61239.2024.10556109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556109","olfactory system;co-culture model;olfactory epithelium organoids;olfactory bulb neuronal network","In vivo;Olfactory;Neurons;Neural circuits;Olfactory bulb;Encoding;Integrated circuit modeling","","","","9","IEEE","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the mechanisms of these inter-system interactions have yet to be well-characterized. Here, we employ directed functional connectivity networks estimated from source-localized EEG to uncover how brain regions across the olfactory, emotion and reward systems integrate organically into cross-system communities. Using the integration coefficient, a graph theoretic measure, we quantified the effect of exposure to fragrance stimuli of different hedonic values (high vs low pleasantness levels) on inter-systems interactions. Our analysis focused on beta band activity (13-30 Hz), which is known to facilitate integration of cortical areas involved in sensory perception. Higher-pleasantness stimuli induced elevated integration for the reward system, but not for the emotion and olfactory systems. Furthermore, the nodes of reward system showed more outward connections to the emotion and olfactory systems than inward connections from the respective systems. These results suggest the centrality of the reward system—supported by beta oscillations—in actively coordinating multi-system interactivity to give rise to hedonic experiences during olfactory perception.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629919","Olfactory perception;Community detection;Integration;Reward system;EEG","Measurement;Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Biology","Brain;Emotions;Odorants;Olfactory Perception;Smell","3","","24","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large-scale ex-vivo recordings from OB interconnected layers were recently obtained using high-density CMOS-based biosensors, allowing network-wide investigations of OB electrophysiological properties to uncover layer-specific firing patterns and their dynamical features. Here, we examine changes in simultaneously recorded multi-unit spiking activity and local field potential oscillations focusing on three OB layers in different drug-induced activations. Furthermore, electrically evoked responses of OB circuitry were also analyzed, as delivery of electrical stimuli to the glomerulus layer elicits a response that mimics the natural activation following a sensory input.

The vesicle percentage of the cell area varied between 24% and 30%. In a blinded study we found no significant effects of cholinergic agents on parameters of vesicle number or vesicle diameter. Unexpectedly, pilocarpine treatment increased olfactory gland size, probably by inducing cell swelling. In conclusion, we have established a quantitative EM assay for olfactory gland activation and provided new data on basic olfactory gland cell characteristics.

The purpose of this study is to investigate how well these chemosensors perform in odor detection and discrimination. We found that response patterns of each olfactory neuron differed between odors, but were repeatable to the same odor. Based on multivariate analysis, an array of olfactory neuron recorded from a single rat carried sufficient and reliable information to discriminate odors. In addition, the odor detection and discrimination capability was reproducible across rats. Further, the olfactory neurons were sensitive to concentration change and their responses were dose dependent.

The most obvious of these were extensive local accumulations of large inclusion bodies, totally disrupting the normal morphology of such affected areas of olfactory epithelium. Even in areas where these deposits were absent, other significant signs of ageing were noted in the seemingly unaffected OE of all older mice studied. Quantitative analysis of semi-thin resin sections revealed that the OE of aged mice was significantly reduced in thickness, and with significantly fewer olfactory sensory neurons, irrespective of whether or not inclusions were present. In addition, pale cells, which have been suggested to be a form of degenerating cells, were more abundant in aged OE. The straight, sharp boundary between respiratory and olfactory epithelia which is seen in young adults became irregular and disrupted with age due to an intermingling of the respiratory and olfactory cells. Such structural alterations may parallel olfactory dysfunction reputed to occur in older mammals.","1477-9986","","10.1093/oxfordjournals.jmicro.a023653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8161437","olfactory epithelium;ageing;olfactory sensory neurons;dendritic knobs;inclusion bodies;degeneration","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This display can control emit for a unit of 667 sec. It has been found out that the shortest time of pulse ejection which everyone can sense is 33 msec in this preliminary experiment. So we measured olfactory characteristics for 33 msec of pulse ejection. “Response time” and “Duration of scent perception” were measured for pulse ejection. Further, we defined and measured the minimum ejection interval that subject could discriminate the two individually emitted pulses of scent, which we call “Separable detection threshold”.

Traditional feature extraction methods are often cumbersome and depend greatly on the experience of the researcher. The failure of feature extraction seriously deteriorates the performance of subsequent pattern recognition algorithms. In addition, inherent sensor signal shifts among sensing systems with identical configurations affect E-nose performance. Therefore, due to the unfavorable performance of empirical feature extraction and poor reproducibility, the odor detection ability of E-nose systems has deteriorated. In this article, a bionic olfactory signal processing (BOSP) network based on a spiking neural network (SNN) is proposed to address these issues. Inspired by the structure of the olfactory bulb in mammals, the system has two components: a virtual olfactory receptor (VOR) layer and a bionic olfactory bulb (BOB) layer. The VORs convert the sensor response signals into spike sequences through two spike coding strategies. The BOBs, consisting of mitral cells and granule cells, extract spatiotemporal features from the spike sequences. The proposed BOSP network is a feature-level model that automatically extracts useful features from the sensor array outputs without applying traditional and tedious feature extraction steps, which can subsequently cascade various classifiers. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the BOSP network not only shows better feature extraction capability than several state-of-the-art methods but also exhibits promising shift suppression ability.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3270024","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176220,U20A20227); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10112635","Bionic olfactory signal processing (BOSP);electronic nose (E-nose);feature extraction;shift suppression;spiking neural network (SNN)","Olfactory;Sensors;Feature extraction;Neurons;Biological system modeling;Encoding;Olfactory bulb","","9","","40","IEEE","28 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose in this paper a systematic approach for semi-automatic olfactory glomerulus segmentation. This method consists of two phases. The former phase aims to highlight within-glomerulus regions, appraise the amount of recognizable glomeruli in each z-slice, and to suggest a seed used to generate an initial contour for every recognizable glomerulus. The latter phase, starting from the initial contour of each recognizable glomerulus, propagates the initial contour information to adjacent slices recursively until the glomerulus' contours on all z-slices are obtained.

In a line of transgenic mice expressing spH under the control of a receptor neuron-specific promoter (OMP), odorant-evoked patterns of receptor neuron input to ~10% of the olfactory bulb can be imaged with excellent spatial resolution and sensitivity during single brief odorant presentations. Odor representations are similar across mice and can be imaged repeatedly in the same animal for months.

Yet, understanding the neuronal architecture of the olfactory system is incomplete. As a result, there is no complete description of the algorithms responsible for the computation of odor identity (what type of molecules is present in the environment) and intensity (how many molecules are present). Here we model the olfactory system as a recurrent neural network and attempt to derive these algorithms from the first principles. To this end, we present the network with simulated odorant mixtures and modeling the changes of concentration in the nose during natural sniffing. The goal of the network is to compute, in real time, the known odor identity and intensity. We trained the network to do so using backpropagation to derive an optimized algorithm which implements this task. Our model spontaneously develops an early recognition of both identity and intensity, also known as primacy coding. This implies that the network recognizes input stimuli early in the sniff cycle. This feature is not enforced on the network and emerges as a solution to the problem of identifying smell by the network ab initio. The model also shows activity patterns reminiscent of predictive coding. Overall, we used a deep learning model as an inference tool to investigate candidate algorithms of the olfactory system and identified two mechanisms which may be involved in recognizing olfactory stimuli.","2576-2303","979-8-3503-5405-8","10.1109/IEEECONF60004.2024.10942886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10942886","simple recurrent neural network;olfactory system;backpropagation;Dale's law;primacy;predictive coding","Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Microprocessors;Olfactory;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Predictive coding;Prediction algorithms","","","","44","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have visualized these patterns by loading mouse olfactory receptor neurons with calcium-sensitive dye and imaging odorant-evoked fluorescence signals from their axon terminals. This approach allows us to characterize how odors are represented at the level of input to the olfactory bulb. Receptor neurons converge onto and terminate within spherical neuropile called glomeruli. Using two-photon imaging, we found that all neurons innervating a glomerulus show similar odorant response properties, confirming the idea that glomeruli act as functional units in representing odors. With wide-field imaging, we found that odorant representations tend to involve input to many, widely distributed glomeruli, and that these representations change dramatically with odorant concentration. We also found that input to glomeruli is temporally complex, with receptor neuron input showing both glomerulus- and odorant-specific kinetics. Thus, representations of odorant information in the olfactory bulb are spatially distributed, tend to involve large numbers of glomeruli, and show complex but stereotyped temporal dynamics. We hypothesize that all of these parameters are important in coding information about both odorant identity and concentration.","1094-687X","0-7803-7789-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280210","","Olfactory;Visualization;In vivo;Neurons;Optical imaging;Mice;Biomedical imaging;Calcium;Biomedical optical imaging;Fluorescence","","","","5","IEEE","5 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we report the first investigations of a `Super E-Nose' that incorporates Ors from both the model organism Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly (DmOr) and the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgOr). Furthermore, we report how an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in the form of a hybrid double hidden layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), can be used to determine the optimal Ors that provide the best prediction performance in the classification of unknown odorants into their respective chemical class. Our findings demonstrate how 3-Or arrays consisting of DmOr only, AgOr only, or cross-species DmOr-AgOr combinations correctly classified all unknown odorants of the validation set. In addition, we report that all 3-Or combinations perform equally well as the complete 74 DmOr-AgOr array.

Biological olfactory systems are able to discriminate weak, transient, broad-band signals ranging over a poorly-defined parameter space, and therefore outperform current artificial nose systems in several respects. A biological olfactory sense organ, the insect antenna, has been exploited in a hybrid-device biosensor. An algorithm was developed to analyze the electrophysiological responses recorded from a sensor array comprised of antennae from different species of insects. A training period during which the array was exposed to known target odors established response signatures for those odors. Subsequent odor stimuli were then classified using a forced-choice nearest neighbor technique.

In this study, we developed an olfactory measurement system that uses pulse ejection. Unlike existing olfactory measurement techniques, our olfactory display employing pulse ejection measures olfaction by changing the ejection quantity. We conducted an experiment that measured and quantified the human olfactory characteristics in precise detail in response to pulsed scents. The results reveal that people are able to sense extremely small quantities of scent. Measurements were finished in approximately 5 min and were influenced very little by lingering scent.

However, with the rise of virtual reality (VR) as a mood induction procedure (MIP), few studies have incorporated olfactory stimuli into emotion induction in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Considering the differences in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics between sensory stimuli, all previous two-dimensional (2D) and 3D emotional studies have been less effective in reality because they only use visual and audio senses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel EEG signal dataset based on OVR. We systematically analyzed the influence of olfactory stimuli on emotion induction in a VR environment from a neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, synchronous EEG signals were collected from 65 participants as they watched positive and negative videos in traditional VR and OVR. Their power spectral densities (PSDs) were then calculated to compare the differences in brain activation between their VR and OVR modes during the induction of positive and negative emotions, while their brain states were classified after feature selection. The results showed that olfactory stimuli enhanced EEG responses for positive emotions, but the opposite was true for negative emotions. Additionally, the recognition rate of brain emotional states was more than 90% under both positive and negative emotions, while the high-frequency β and γ bands could effectively distinguish VR and OVR modes.

It is implemented in C to run on Macintosh, IBM, or UNIX platforms. The output can be set by parameter optimization to point, limit cycle, quasi-periodic, or aperiodic (presumably chaotic) attractors. The first three classes of solutions are stable under variations of parameters and perturbations by input, but they are biologically unrealistic. Chaotic solutions simulate the properties of time-dependent densities of olfactory action potentials and EEGs, but they transit into the basins of point, limit cycle, or quasi-periodic attractors after only a few seconds of simulated run time. Despite use of double precision arithmetic giving 64-bit words, the KIII model is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the terminal bit of parameters and inputs. The global stability decreases as the number of coupled oscillators in the OB is increased, indicating that attractor crowding reduces the size of basins in the model to the size of the digitizing step (/spl sim/10/sup -16/). Chaotic solutions having biological verisimilitude are robustly stabilized by introducing low-level, additive noise from a random number generator at two biologically determined points: rectified, spatially incoherent noise on each receptor input line, and spatially coherent noise to the AON, a global control point receiving centrifugal inputs from various parts of the forebrain. Methods are presented for evaluating global stability in the high dimensional system from measurements of multiple chaotic outputs. Ranges of stability are shown for variations of connection weights (gains) in the KIII model.

To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.","2576-2303","979-8-3503-5405-8","10.1109/IEEECONF60004.2024.10942624","NIH(grant numbers:CNS-1956190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10942624","deep learning;computational neuroscience;convolutional neural networks;olfactory signal processing;equivariance","Training;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Olfactory;Biological systems;Feature extraction;Amino acids;Spatial filters;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Convolutional neural networks","","","","50","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results demonstrate that galvanic olfactory stimulation using a pair of electrodes at the nasal bridge and the dorsal surface of the neck induces virtual irritating intranasal chemosensation. This observation suggests that, at the very least, the proposed galvanic olfactory stimulation method induces irritating intranasal chemosensation. This implies that an electric current stimulates the trigeminal nerve in the inner region of the nasal cavity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate virtual intranasal chemosensation using non-invasive electrical stimulation of the external surface of the nose.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100851","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Promotion Individual Research to Nurture the Seeds of Future Innovation and Organizing Unique, Innovative Network (PRESTO)(grant numbers:JPMJPR19J1); Japan Society for The Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory)(grant numbers:18K19828); Osaka University; The University of Tokyo; Panasonic Corporation Eco Solutions Company and Omron Software Company Ltd.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500231","Chemesthesis;chemosensation;galvanic olfactory stimulation;olfactory display;pungent odor","Olfactory;Electrodes;Electrical stimulation;Olfactory bulb;Human computer interaction;Skin;Current","","7","","45","CCBY","28 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many individuals have a strong preference for sugary beverages and often find beverages with lower sugar content to be less satisfying. Attempts to switch to less sugary options are frequently short-lived, leading to a return to higher-sugar beverages. Recognizing that 75 – 95% of taste perception is influenced by scent, we investigated a scent-based approach to reduce sugar intake while preserving the perception of sweetness. This study introduces an olfactory interface in the form of a mug named “Aromug,” designed to emit a sweet scent in sync with the drinking action. Aromug incorporates motion sensing and scent presentation functions to enhance the perceived sweetness of a beverage, thereby encouraging a gradual reduction in sugar intake. Our experiments, involving 33 participants, demonstrated that the combined scents of sugar-free coffee and chocolate increased the perception of sweetness (p  $= 1.641 \times 10^{-2}$ ). The study also found that the simultaneous presentation of scent and visual cues improved taste satisfaction and sweetness perception. Additionally, we observed variations in sweetness preference related to age and frequency of coffee consumption. It was particularly observed that people in their 20s and those who frequently drink coffee tend to perceive the taste of beverages as sweeter. This suggests a potential for Aromug to customize the scent experience based on individual preferences, offering a novel way to encourage healthier beverage choices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3401392","JST, PRESTO, Japan(grant numbers:JPMJPR21P7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530960","Olfaction;olfactory interfaces;olfactory display;scents;taste evaluation;smell;olfactory perception;behavior change support","Sugar;Olfactory;Visualization;Dairy products;Blood;Glucose;Diabetes;Taste buds","","","","43","CCBYNCND","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Model-based approaches for characterizing tools and system compounds are used to optimize the sampling of odorants, to predict the chromatographical behavior of analytes and to find the ideal composition of system compounds for an application-specific sensor system.

As a next challenge, we aimed at the continuous monitoring of odorant.

Then, the changes in [totalHb] of normosmia healthy subjects and patients with PD were compared. In all normosmia healthy subjects and eight patients with PD, isovaleric acid caused remarkable changes of [totalHb], especially in the lower areas of the frontal cortex. These activated areas may be related to the orbitofrontal cortex, corresponding to olfactory cortices. However, in fourteen patients with PD, isovaleric acid caused no changes.

Owing to the individual difference in the sensory adaption of human smell function, the olfactory responses usually exhibit large inter-individual difference and change over time after repeated stimulations. The traditional analysis tools, such as statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (fMRI) analysis, utilize the paradigm-based linear correlation and statistical techniques to discriminate the activation areas from background activities. However, these traditional approaches extract olfactory-induced responses using the stereotypic template or paradigm generated model. The olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses affected by internal/external events, such as changes of smell fatigue and attention, are not considered and therefore could result in misleading results. In this paper, owing to the stochastic characteristic of olfactory-induced responses, we adopted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to extract olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses in MRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals. The MEMD is an efficient data-driven approach to extract nonlinear and non-stationary signals, which is an improved method to expand traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) from one channel to multi-channel processing. We applied MEMD to decompose time series of BOLD signals from each slice into multivariate intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The MEMD enables common features of different scales in an image slice to be arranged in distinct IMFs.

In particular, the retronasal smell is known to be more critical in influencing perceived taste than the orthonasal smell. In this study, we propose a smart lid called Kaolid that changes the taste of beverages by presenting scent information as retronasal smell. Kaolid achieves retronasal smell by equipping a small, lightweight straw- or cup-type olfactory device with a sensor that senses drinking behavior and the amount of water in the cup. The straw-type device injects the scent into the tube through the middle of the straw, delivering the scent to the user's mouth simultaneously as the beverage is being consumed. The cup-type device injects the scent into the cup through the lid and delivers the scent to the user's mouth at the beginning of drinking to achieve in-mouth scenting. The concept of Kaolid is to promote water consumption, considered insipid, by altering the sense of taste through a scent presented when drinking the beverage.","2766-8576","978-1-6654-5381-3","10.1109/PerComWorkshops56833.2023.10150412","JST(grant numbers:JPMJPR21P7); PRESTO(grant numbers:JPMJPR21P7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10150412","Olfaction;Olfactory Interfaces;Olfactory display;Scents;Taste evaluation;Smell;Olfactory Perception","Pervasive computing;Conferences;Olfactory;Mouth;Electron tubes;Behavioral sciences","","1","","21","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over 95% of PD patients present with severe olfactory loss. Almost all olfactory tests are subjective. Therefore, olfactometry cannot be performed unless the patient himself/herself notices olfactory impairment. When the condition of the patients was diagnosed as a PD, they had completely lost their sense of olfaction. Thus, an objective olfactory test is required to measure the olfactory function of patients with PD. In this study, we examined the subjective olfactory test (T&T olfactometry) and the objective olfactory test (cerebral blood volume changes under odor stimulation by using near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) in PD patients and age-matched elder normosmic volunteers. The results of the subjective and objective olfactory tests of PD patients were significantly worse than those of the normal volunteers. These results suggested that most of the PD patients had olfactory impairment and half of the PD patients did not notice their olfactory impairment. In case of the latter group of patients, subjective olfactometry is not useful. The objective olfactory test is required to measure the olfactory function of patients with PD. Multi-channel NIRS is expected to be widely used in the future for clinical objective olfactometry. Olfactometry may be an early screening test for the diagnosis of PD.","","978-1-4673-1618-7","10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275744","Olfactory Impairment;Parkinson's disease;T&T olfactometry;near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)","Olfactory;Spectroscopy;Optical fiber devices;Educational institutions;Materials;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical variables measurement","","","","15","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the development of a breath sensor for breath synchronization, we next developed an olfactory ejection system to present scent on each inspiration. We then measured human olfactory characteristics in order to determine the most suitable method for presenting scent on an inspiration.

Meanwhile, some odorant samples to be detected are precious and hard to collect. Here, we developed a gas phase odorant detection system using cell expressing insect OR. We then tested it with target ligand as well as reference gas and obtained the typical OR response. After this, we checked the influence of stimulation duration and liquid thickness to it. Moreover, the detection limit and selectivity were confirmed by a series of experiments. In addition, the sample concentration dependency was exhibited and a hypothesis towards inhibition phenomenon was proposed. Lastly, a human sensory test was operated to compare the performance of our system with human olfaction. In our system, only sub-milliliter target odorant was enough to trigger the OR response. Altogether, these results suggest this odor biosensor can be applied to gas phase odorant detection in multiple aspects owning to its detection capability and rapid response.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3103286","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP18H03773); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509011","Gas phase;odorant detection;odor biosensor;olfactory receptor","Sensors;Fluorescence;Liquids;Olfactory;Electron tubes;Gas detectors;Brightness","","12","","28","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This information serves as an input to a network of mitral cells with center on-off surround lateral inhibition, which enhances the initial contrast among odors and decouples odor identity from intensity.

We propose a novel strategy for encoding intensity-invariant stimuli identity based on representing relative rather than absolute stimulus features. In this scheme, dependence on relative amplitudes of stimulus features makes identity invariant to intensity and monotonous non-linearities of neuronal responses. We propose that the olfactory system represents stimulus identity using the information that a subset of odorant receptor types responds more strongly than all receptor types in the complement set. We show that this information is sufficient to ensure the robust recovery of a sparse stimulus (odorant) via elastic net loss minimization. This minimization is performed under the constraints imposed by the relationships between these two receptor sets. We formulate this problem using its dual Lagrangian. We show that the dual problem can be solved by a neural network whose Lyapunov function represents the dual Lagrangian. We thus propose that networks in the piriform cortex compute odorant identity and implement dual computations with the sparse activities of individual neurons representing Lagrange multipliers.","2576-2303","978-1-5386-1823-3","10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8335409","","Olfactory;Receptor (biochemistry);Minimization;Mathematical model;Decoding;Encoding;Neurons","","","","21","IEEE","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Just as AI helped to make supercomputers possible, OI may help create biocomputers. Even though AI has increased the capabilities of technology to unimaginable heights, it still appears immature and is steadily moving toward cognitive computing to push the envelope even farther. In contrast to AI, OI is a new multidisciplinary computer area that attempts to be more approachable. OI has the ability to produce novel biocomputers, such as organoids, that use parts derived from live organisms to perform computational tasks. Organoids, such as human nasal organoids, are microscopic tissue cultures made from stem cells that mimic some of the functions of real organs.

Our approach is a counterpart of spatial AR, that overlays information onto the real world. In order to cover various aspects of olfactory experiences, we make use of multiple methods: wind and vortex rings. We investigated the human sensitivity on the wind direction to show the design requirement of wind display. Also, we considered to use a vortex ring to transfer the scent encapsulated in it. By letting two vortex rings collide and collapse at the target point, a local scent distribution can be generated in the air. However, this approach has been suffered from the uncertainty of vortex collision. For stable generation of mid-air scent distribution, we explored various aspects in expelling vortex rings.","","978-1-5386-8327-9","10.1109/ISOEN.2019.8823180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823180","Virtual reality;olfactory display","Olfactory;Fans;Apertures;Virtual reality;Haptic interfaces;Shape;Trajectory","","8","","10","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our experimental findings suggested that, with appropriate selections, mold odorants can be successfully differentiated even amidst the presence of background odorant components.","2168-9229","979-8-3503-6351-7","10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10784913","Bio-Oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN)(grant numbers:JP21K05613,JP21K14168,JP21K19107,JP22K18416,JP24K17285); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21K05613,JP21K14168,JP21K19107,JP22K18416,JP24K17285); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10784913","odorant biosensor;insect olfactory receptor;moldy odorants;sensor array;background odorants","Sensitivity;Insects;Olfactory;Crops;Food products;Biosensors;Contamination;Sensor arrays;Testing;Principal component analysis","","","","8","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the olfactory cortex is considered to process the spatio-temporal information generated in the olfactory bulb, it is not clear what kind of information is brought to the cortex and what kind of pattern is being generated in the cortex by the input temporal pattern. It is shown that certain types of the input pulse train induce a long lasting oscillation spreading all over the network. The oscillation is organized based on the Hebbian learning rule so as to produce a characteristic pattern for each input pattern. The patterns of spatio-temporal oscillation become different depending on input patterns. The patterns are also changed depending on the learning processes. It is highly possible that this type of spatio-temporal patterns is essential for the odor recognition.","","0-7803-1421-2","10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713865","","Pattern classification;Brain modeling;Olfactory;Neurons;Biological neural networks;Information processing;Biomembranes;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Intelligent networks;Physics","","","1","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A deeper comprehension of the roles, interactions, and signaling cascades of olfactory receptor may help in the identification of new olfactory targets via complex interactions. Moreover, the mechanism of olfaction in humans remains relatively understudied compared to other senses. Most of the studies have only focused on a single gene or protein related to the human olfactory system. This study investigated key proteins found in the human olfactory system using Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) networks.

To test these models, a realistic artifact of the olfactory epithelium was developed as a large sensor array mimicking some features of biological ORNs, in particular, the broad and overlapping selectivity to many odors, the combinatorial response, the high level of redundancy, and the different dynamic ranges exhibited by same types of ORNs. The sensor array is composed of 16 384 elements arranged in four smaller arrays of 64 × 64 interdigitated electrodes deposited on a borosilicate substrate. To mimic the redundancy of the biological ORNs, tens of organic conductive polymers were chosen as active sensing materials because of their broad and diverse, but overlapping, specificity to different classes of volatile organic compounds.

In this study, we examined how pleasantness and intensity of fragrances relate to different grades of positive affect. Our results show that greater odor pleasantness and intensity are independently associated with stronger positive affect. Pleasantness has a greater influence than intensity in evoking a positive vs. neutral affect, whereas intensity is more impactful than pleasantness in evoking an extreme positive vs. positive response. Autonomic response, as assessed by the galvanic skin response (GSR) was found to decrease with increasing pleasantness but not intensity.

However, there is little work on the influence of olfactory stimuli in VR. Consequently, we investigated the effects of olfactory stimuli and VR on food cravings. In particular, we examined the hypothesis that olfactory and interaction with food in VR can further increase food cravings. The results of this study show that VR can elicit similar effects as exposure to traditional cues when compared to a neutral baseline. Furthermore, the added olfactory cues increased food cravings and the urge to eat the presented food, which also increased when participants were allowed to interact with the virtual food.

Sequence of spikes generated by a neuron is completely characterized by the neural response function. Spiking models involve dynamics over time scales ranging from channel openings that can take less than a millisecond, to collective neural network processes that may be several orders of magnitude slower. The tuning specification between the mitral and tufted cells and their glomeruli plays a vital role in mitral and tufted cell's spike response to a particular odor. The experiments indicate that a single mitral /tufted cell show excitatory spike response to a range of odor molecules with similar molecular configuration. The behavior of the receptor cells in response to the simulated odors is close to the actual biological behavior of the receptors present in the olfactory epithelium.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244321","","Neurotransmitters;Neurons;Olfactory;Nerve fibers;Clouds;Anatomy;Computer science;Character generation;Cells (biology);Biological system modeling","","","","6","IEEE","10 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed bionic model, comparative analyses were performed with several classic classification methods and various bionic models that were previously developed by other researchers.

However, much of the neuronal ""middleware"" of the fruit fly is unknown: for instance, how its neural architecture gives rise to functionalities such as odor categorization. Moreover, there is potential for the fruit fly neural network (FFNN) architecture in modelling Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - the former having been ""crafted"" over time by generations of evolutionary adaptation. In this work we hope to gain some insight with regards to both problem domains: firstly, with regards to understanding the ""middleware"" of the fruit fly neural network; secondly, with regards to constructing FFNN-derived ANNs. In particular, we recognize that there is a new opportunity to explore these problem domains in light of recent work on the EM (Electron Microscopy) ""hemibrain"" - the most comprehensive (to date) EM-derived digital reconstruction of the fruit fly brain, comprising 25,000 neurons (with labels for all neurons and synapses) [1]. Using the hemibrain, we look to the fruit fly olfactory system for the purposes of both exploring its neural architecture and creating an odor classifier. Our FFNN-derived ANN is - at present - fully-connected and uses the 800 most prevalent neurons in the fruit fly olfactory circuit (Antenna Lobe, Mushroom Body Calyx, and Lateral Horn [2]); it also has weight values assigned based on the number of synapses between neurons (an assumption made by the hemibrain authors [1]). Our initial dataset for odor classification includes 33 samples; each with 16 input components (individual resistance values from an array of 16 metal oxide sensors) and 4 output classes (air, ethanol, acetone, or mixed). We augment the dataset to size 33,033 with input noise based on a Gaussian normal distribution.

To this extent, in this study we computed instantaneous estimates from heartbeat series gathered from 32 healthy subjects (age: 26±2; 16M) undergoing hedonic olfactory elicitation. Each subject exhibited a similar olfactory perception threshold, and scored five 5s stimuli in terms of arousal and valence level using the self-assessment manikin test.

Physiological experiments have demonstrated odorant sensitivities down to the picomolar range in preparations from the sensory epithelium. However, the contemporary model for olfactory signal transduction provides that odorants bind to olfactory receptors with relatively low specificity and consequently low affinity, making this detection of low-concentration odorants theoretically difficult to understand. We employ a computational model to demonstrate how olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) sensitivity can be tuned by modulation of receptor-effector coupling and/or by other mechanisms regulating spare receptor capacity, thus resolving this conundrum. The EC10–90 intensity tuning ranges (ITRs) of whole olfactory glomeruli and postsynaptic mitral cells are considerably broader than the commensurate ITRs of individual OSNs. These data are difficult to reconcile with certain contemporary hypotheses that convergent OSNs in mammals exhibit a homogeneous population of olfactory receptors and identical tuning for odor stimuli. We show that heterogeneity in spare receptor capacities within a convergent OSN population can increase the ITR (EC10–90) of a convergent population of OSNs regardless of the presence or absence of a diversity of receptor expression within the population. The modulation of receptor-effector coupling has been observed in OSNs; other mechanisms for cellular regulation of spare receptor capacity are also highly plausible (e.g., quantitative regulation of the relative expression levels of receptor and effector proteins). We present a model illustrating that these processes can underlie both how OSNs come to exhibit high sensitivity to odorant stimuli without necessitating increased ligand-receptor binding affinities or specificities and how a population of convergent OSNs could exhibit a broader concentration sensitivity than its individual constituent neurons, even given a population expressing identical odorant receptors. The regulation of spare receptor capacity may play an important role in the olfactory system's ability to reliably detect low odor concentrations, discriminate odor intensities, and segregate this intensity information from representations of odor quality.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976699300016188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790905","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To understand the visual-olfactory effect on different olfactory characteristics, a portable olfactory display that can control the intensity and direction of odors was developed.

Although electronic noses are often compared to their biological counterpart, they neither mimic its complex neural architecture nor achieve its performance in discriminating between complex odours. Recent developments in our understanding of the human olfactory system suggest that the olfactory mucosa (the lining of the nasal cavity comprising of a mucous layer and the olfactory epithelium) behaves like a gas chromatograph. Thus receptor cells distributed beneath the mucous layer (within the olfactory epithelium) provide both spatial and temporal chemosensory information. Here we report on the development of an artificial olfactory microsystem that replicates the basic structure of the olfactory mucosa. Our system employs an 80 element chemoresistive microsensor array fabricated on a 10 mm times 10 mm silicon die. The microsensors possess carbon black/polymer nanocomposite films as the odour-sensitive elements. In addition, a micro-fluidic package has been fabricated by micro- stereolithography, with an integrated channel to act as the nasal cavity (channel dimensions 500 mum times 500 mum times 2.4 m). This channel has been coated with Parylene C, as the retentive layer, in order to mimic the partitioning mucous layer of the olfactory mucosa. The fluidic package has been placed directly on top of the sensor array and has evenly spaced openings along the channel that encompass blocks of 5 sensing elements. Results show that this biomimetic system yields both spatial and temporal odorant signals, with a temporal chemical retention period of up to 110 seconds. Data analysis has revealed improvements in its ability to discriminate between two simple odours and a set of complex odours (i.e. essential oils). We conclude that closer emulation of the olfactory mucosa and nasal cavity could yield better odour discrimination and hence be superior to existing electronic nose technologies.","0537-9989","0-86341-627-6","10.1049/ic:20060452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662182","","","","1","","","","31 Jul 2006","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The network input and output are usually represented as series of spikes (delta function or more complex shapes). Plasticity SNNs have an advantage of being able to recurrently process information. Spike-time dependent plasticity can enhance signal transmission by selectively strengthening synaptic connections that transmit precisely timed spikes at the expense of those synapses that transmit poorly timed spikes. Complete theory describes the spiking network's digital implementation. Theory is verified using simulation of a biologically plausible odor environment with 1023 odor receptor inputs.

Based on our understanding of this system, our model exploits plausible neural mechanisms to transform the massive and high-dimensional spatial and temporal input of the olfactory receptor neurons into a neural population encoding based on synchrony and frequency, consistent with known physiology. We demonstrate the capabilities of our Antennal Lobe model in the context of a classification task of different olfactory stimuli of varying concentrations. We show that the generated neural representation conveys both the identity and the concentration of each stimuli.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-6918-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5596749","","Neurons;Biological system modeling;Encoding;Olfactory;Antennas;Insects","","1","","15","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When dealing with different gas sensors, these processing methods might require meticulous adjustments, and each sensor might need own specific processing strategy. Such strategies are often tedious and overly reliant on intricate feature engineering, leading to time-consuming operations and poor reproducibility. To address this issue, this paper proposes a biomimetic olfactory perception model inspired by the mammalian olfactory system. Unlike traditional e-nose methods, our model deeply simulates the core structures and functions of the mammalian olfactory system, especially the biomimetic design for neural conduction and information encoding. This allows the model to directly handle the raw sensor responses of the e-nose, eliminating the conventional preprocessing and feature selection steps. The experimental results show that our biomimetic model achieved an average recognition rate of 95.8% on a traditional Chinese medicine dataset, significantly outperforming the traditional method's 90.84%. The model not only demonstrates excellent feature extraction capabilities but also shows extreme robustness when the types and numbers of sensors change, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the electronic nose in practical applications.","","979-8-3503-0583-8","10.1109/CCISP59915.2023.10355792","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171066); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355792","sensor array;digital signal processing;spike encoding;neural network;olfactory model","Biomimetics;Biological system modeling;Olfactory;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Electronic noses;Encoding","","","","24","IEEE","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has led to a new communication technology, molecular communication (MC), using molecules to encode, transmit, and receive information. Despite extensive research, an innate MC method found abundantly in nature—olfactory or odor communication—has not been thoroughly studied using information and communication technologies (ICT). Existing studies focus on digitizing this sense and developing actuators without examining odor-based information coding and MC principles, significantly limiting its application potential. Hence, cross-disciplinary research is needed to uncover the fundamentals of this unconventional communication modality from an ICT perspective. The ways of natural odor MC in nature need to be anatomized and engineered for end-to-end communication among humans and human-made things to enable several multi-sense augmented reality technologies reinforced with olfactory senses for novel applications and solutions in the Internet of Everything (IoE). This paper introduces odor-based molecular communication (OMC) and thoroughly examines olfactory systems, exploring odor communication in nature, including odor information, channels, reception, spatial perception, and cognitive functions. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison of various communication systems sets the foundation for further investigation.

This article attempts to assess the degree of OPD of subjects from their hemodynamic response to olfactory stimuli. This is done in two phases. In the first (training) phase, a regression model is developed to assess the degree of concentration levels of an olfactory stimulus by a subject from her hemodynamic response to the stimulus. In the second (test) phase, the model is employed to predict the possible concentration level experienced by the subject in [0, 100] scale. The difference between the model-predicted response and the oral response (the center value of the qualitative grades) of the subject about her perceived concentration level is regarded as the quantitative measure of the degree of subject’s olfactory degradation. The novelty of the present research lies in the design of a general type-2 fuzzy regression model, which is capable of handling uncertainty due to the presence of intrasession and intersession variations in the brain responses to olfactory stimuli. The attractive feature of the article lies in adaptive tuning of secondary membership functions to reduce model prediction error in an evolutionary optimization setting. The effect of such adaptation in secondary measures is utilized to adjust the corresponding primary memberships in order to reduce the uncertainty involved in the regression process. The proposed regression model has good prediction accuracy and high time efficiency as evident from average percentage success rate (PSR) and runtime complexity analysis, respectively.

This paper presents an active olfactory sensing system that intends to be applicable to search for odour sources in outdoor environments. Three modular intelligent modules compose this olfactory system: two gas sensing nostrils and a directional thermal anemometer. The information coming from the sensing modules is fused with the spatio-temporal localization of a mobile robot in order to estimate the localization of a specific odour source. The mobile robot is controlled by a state-based odour-searching algorithm. Each sensing module self-adjust its characteristics (sensibility, selectivity and time-response) in order to optimise the information perceived during each searching state.

Namely, sensory processing in the honey bee, a universal model for studying olfaction, is considered. Existing studies have focused on its antennal lobe, wherein only the responses of its functional units, known as glomeruli, have been accessible. Here, high temporal resolution calcium imaging is deployed to track the dynamics of odor-evoked activity beyond this processing stage. The responses in the somata outside of the antennal lobe are recorded, showing for the first time how the glomerular signals are transformed before entering the higher brain centers. A transfer function approach is applied to capture as a “gray box model” the remarkably heterogeneous signal transformations between odor input and glomerular response, and between glomerular signals and somata activity. The somata are tentatively mapped to the glomeruli via Granger causality, while machine learning classification and clustering allow grouping common properties regarding response amplitudes and temporal profiles. The obtained low-order transfer functions display time- and frequency-domain input-output properties closely similar to the biological system. Because transfer functions have universal applicability, once they have been determined, it is readily possible to design corresponding analog electronic circuits, with possible future applications in sensor signal conditioning. To exemplify this, examples based on resistor-capacitor (RC) networks and operational amplifiers are physically built and confirmed to generate responses highly correlated to the initial biological recordings.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149822","University of Trento through the Strategic Project BRAin Network DYnamics (BRANDY); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706471","Analog filters;calcium imaging;circuit design;honey bee;neuroscience;olfaction;systems biology;systems engineering;transfer functions","Transfer functions;Soma;Imaging;Modeling;Biological system modeling;Calcium;Olfactory","","","","73","CCBY","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design involves determining the weights of the selected recurrent dynamics so that for a given base stimulus, the dynamics converges to one of several optima (local attractors) on the given Lyapunov energy surface. Experiments undertaken reveal that for small noise amplitude below a selected threshold, the dynamics essentially converges to fixed stable attractor. However, with a slight increase in noise amplitude above the selected threshold, the local attractor of the dynamics shifts in the neighborhood of the attractor obtained for the noise-free standard stimuli. The other important issues undertaken in this paper include a novel algorithm for evolutionary feature selection and data-point reduction from multiple experimental EEG trials using principal component analysis.

Even though there are many types of HPNs reported in literature, none have the constructs to model BNNs. Hence, a new class of HPNs is proposed.

The input-output relation of populations of neurons is represented as a sigmoid function, with a single parameter determining threshold, slope and amplitude of the curve. This parameter is taken to correspond to the level of neuromodulator and correlated with the level of arousal of an animal.

Due to cross modal effect between vision and olfaction, human tends to feel not olfactory but visual stimulation as scents. First, we asked subjects to smell various aroma chemicals and evaluate their similarity. Based on the data of similarity among aromas, we built a map of smell distance. Next, we selected a few aroma chemicals from the smell distance map and implemented a visual and olfactory display. Then we conducted an assessment experiment of the display. We presented various pictures and the selected aroma chemicals to subjects and asked them what kind of scent they smelled like. In this experiment, we succeed in giving subjects feeling more patterns of scents than the number of selected aroma chemicals. Also, we succeed in making not olfactory stimulation by aroma chemicals but visual stimulation by pictures as scents.

To understand why our nose evolved we must first understand the function of olfaction. To do this requires traveling back in time to the evolution of the first brain. I will describe the hypothesis that the sense of smell evolved as a sense of direction, playing a critical role in navigation and that this function explains why olfactory systems are so plastic and variable in size across animals. The navigation function of olfaction in humans has been largely neglected and I will describe studies showing that humans can orient accurately to odors in real world and virtual reality environments. But why such a nose? To understand this, I return to an evolutionary framework to describe how the first nose, a structure used both for respiration and olfaction, appeared in air-breathing fish. I describe a new hypothesis (PROUST: perceiving and representing odor utility in space and time) to explain how the evolution of air-breathing could have forced vertebrates to segregate olfactory mapping of space to the main olfactory system and the mapping of odors across time to the newly evolved second (vomeronasal) olfactory system. This dichotomy of function and the subsequent conflict between mapping time versus space using odors, could have led to a number of novel vertebrate solutions to sample odors, including the forked tongue of the snake and the human external nose. I will end by proposing that this perspective on the evolution and function of human olfaction could enhance current paradigms in human-robot communication and decision making.","2167-2148","978-1-4503-4336-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8534748","Navigation;sensory evolution;olfaction","Navigation;Evolution (biology);Olfactory;Jacobian matrices;Animals;Neuroscience","","","","2","","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Of all the human sensory systems, olfaction is the least understood in terms of the primary receptor mechanism and biological transduction. It is difficult to describe a set of reference odours that describe the olfactory input. A high degree of signal processing takes place in the olfactory system so that compounds of similar chemical structure can give completely different olfactory responses. That is the reason why the understanding of the olfactory system is relatively poor. The situation is comparable in the case of gustation. Nevertheless, there are many practical applications that require a quantitative or qualitative objective recording of odours or taste. In the following the development in the field of electronic tongue is described. It is a relatively new field. The state-of-the-art in understanding of electronic noses and tongues is discussed.

To exemplify this idea, we present viScent: A six-scent stereo olfactory display capable of conveying olfactory glyphs of varying temperature and direction, as well as a corresponding software system that integrates the display with a traditional visualization display. Finally, we present three applications that make use of the viScent system: A 2D graph visualization, a 2D line and point chart, and an immersive analytics graph visualization in 3D virtual reality.

The proposed system has four fans on the four corners of the screen. The airflows that are generated by these fans collide multiple times to create an airflow that is directed towards the user from a certain position on the screen. By introducing odor vapor into the airflows, the odor distribution is as if an odor source had been placed onto the screen. The generated odor distribution leads the user to perceive the odor as emanating from a specific region of the screen. The position of this virtual odor source can be shifted to an arbitrary position on the screen by adjusting the balance of the airflows from the four fans. Most users do not immediately notice the odor presentation mechanism of the proposed olfactory display system because the airflow and perceived odor come from the display screen rather than the fans. The airflow velocity can even be set below the threshold for airflow sensation, such that the odor alone is perceived by the user. We present experimental results that show the airflow field and odor distribution that are generated by the proposed system. We also report sensory test results to show how the generated odor distribution is perceived by the user and the issues that must be considered in odor presentation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479189","Virtual reality;multimedia;olfactory display;wind dislpay.","Olfactory;Fans;Face;Position measurement;Gas detectors;Educational institutions","Cathode Ray Tube;Computer Graphics;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Humans;Odors;Physical Stimulation;Rheology;Smell;Stimulation, Chemical;User-Computer Interface","83","2","24","IEEE","13 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been widely accepted by teachers and learners in their learning process. Most recently, virtual edutainment has become one of the popular ways for educating the younger generation as it provides an interactive and fun way in learning new things. However, there are limitations when it comes to educate the visually impaired using virtual application as the visually impaired do not have the privilege of sight. It is very difficult to develop engaging edutainment application for those who are visually impaired because they can be easily distracted as they can only hear the sound of video or application. Hence, the usage of edutainment application is very low among visually impaired learners. Therefore, this research studies the requirements of olfactory, haptic and audio enabled 3D application for visually impaired user in a virtual edutainment environment. The preliminary study was conducted on visually impaired people by providing actual shapes of the objects. Based on the results, the main reasons of underutilizing edutainment applications are too much of visual content involved in edutainment applications as well as lack of interaction. Majority of participants agreed that audio enhanced edutainment applications will be more attractive to them if applications come together with Haptic and Olfactory functionalities.","","978-1-5386-8546-4","10.1109/ISCAIE.2019.8743738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743738","edutainment;virtual reality;visually impaired;haptic;olfactory;audio","Haptic interfaces;Olfactory;Education;Visualization;Virtual environments;Media;Three-dimensional displays","","8","","20","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A well-designed computational model that can correctly recognize preference induced by odor stimulation can be vital in the food and perfume industries. Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to study the brain's response to odor stimulation due to its good temporal resolution and low acquisition cost. In this study, we proposed a novel self-attention deep learning framework: Temporal Segment Attention Network (TESANet) to classify the brain state of subjects when they are exposed to pleasant and unpleasant odors. Odor stimulation is a continuous process, the temporal dynamics of the EEG signal should reflect the continuous changes of the brain responses to the given odor, thus we design the model to capture the intercorrelation between time segments of the EEG by utilizing the self-attention mechanism. TESANet consists of a filter-bank layer to extract spectral features, a spatial convolution layer to extract spatial features, a temporal segmentation layer to split the data into overlapping time windows, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to encode the temporal segments, a self-attention layer to decode the temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation between time segments, and finally a fully connected layer for classification.

The novelty of the work lies in Vertical Slice Based General Type-2 Fuzzy Reasoning which employs fuzzy meet and union between the planes of type-2 measurement and observation spaces using the classical definition of t-norms and s-norms. The results of the meet and the union computation are later used as the Lower and Upper Firing Strength of the fired rule to determine the structure of the inference.

In this study, we determined the behavior trajectories of male silk moths using a virtual reality (VR) system. We then modeled these trajectories as a Markov decision process (MDP) and employed inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn their reward function. Furthermore, we estimated the optimal policy from the learned reward function. We then conducted olfactory search simulations and determined that the IRL-based policy could locate odor sources with a high success rate. This was also investigated under environmental conditions different from those faced by real moths on the VR system.

The olfactory stimuli had better results compared to the tactile stimuli for the correct placement of the stimuli in the evaluation phase and there was a significantly lower number of attempts.

Considering these, the focus of this letter is to classify the olfactory EEG signals by exploiting the spectral-domain information of specific frequency bands. In this letter, we present an olfactory EEG signal classification network based on frequency band feature extraction. A frequency band generator is first designed to extract frequency bands via the sliding window technique. Then, a frequency band attention mechanism is proposed to optimize frequency bands for a specific subject adaptively.

In this work we explore the EEG-based scent preference identification method. We first designed an effective and accurate data collection procedure. We proposed a machine learning algorithm, Spatial Temporal Subspace Optimization (STSO), for the discriminative subspace learning and classification modeling. A filter bank contains multiple band-pass filters is used to obtain EEG components from specific frequency ranges. Spatial subspace is constructed by exploring discriminative spatial components to enhance the spatial resolution of the EEG. Through the experiment, we confirm that brain signal can be identified in association with responses to pleasant and unpleasant odors, and there is a temporal pattern of such response because the temporal subspace optimization does improve the prediction result. However, event-related potentials were not present in our EEG data, and we have a discussion on the possible causes and implications. Our preliminary result shows that scent can be identified with moderate accuracy.","","978-1-5386-3276-5","10.1109/ICOT.2017.8336114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8336114","","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Optimization;Brain modeling;Covariance matrices;Training;Robustness","","2","","10","IEEE","12 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The information carried by the phase is compared against the conventional amplitude code in terms of pattern-recovery capabilities. First, the scalar invariance of the KIII with respect to phase information is established. Symmetries and redundancies in the associative memory matrices are then exploited to perform an exhaustive evaluation of patterns on an 8-channel model. Simulation results show that phase information outperforms amplitude information in the recovery of odor patterns from incomplete or corrupted sensory stimulus.","1098-7576","0-7803-7898-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223369","","Olfactory;Biological system modeling;Sensor arrays;Biological information theory;Chemical sensors;Neurons;Electronic noses;Pattern recognition;Signal generators;Computer science","","","","19","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All of these are characteristic of the biological olfactory system, despite activity patterns across receptor arrays often being highly non-sparse. This is possible because the underlying chemosensory data are “signal sparse” - a distinct property, dependent on environmental statistics, that enables sparse coding algorithms to construct representational sparseness in subsequent processing layers. Whereas this can be accomplished by simple rotation in some systems, chemosensory sparse coding requires curvature in the isoresponse surfaces for each neuron owing to the diversity of chemical sources (overcompleteness). We propose that this functional curvature arises from statistical learning processes instantiated in plastic networks of the early olfactory system. Using models of the chemosensory environment, we illustrate the application of sparse coding algorithms to the analysis of chemical signals.","","978-1-5090-2392-9","10.1109/ISOEN.2017.7968888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968888","Sparse coding;source separation;curvature;manifold;olfaction","Neurons;Encoding;Olfactory;Chemicals;Sociology;Statistics;Redundancy","","","","11","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the idea of a BCI that decodes neural responses to different odors and/or enables odor-based neurofeedback is appealing, the results of previous EEG investigations into the olfactory domain are rather inconsistent, particularly when non-primary processing of olfactory signals is investigated. Here we report the results from an EEG study where an olfaction-based instructed-delay task was implemented. We utilized a modern olfactory display and a sensor of respiration to present odors in a strictly controlled fashion. Spatio-spectral EEG properties were analyzed to assess the olfactory-related components. Under these experimental conditions, EEG components representing processing of olfactory information were found around channel C4, where changes were detected for the 12-Hz spectral component. Additionally, significant differences in EEG patterns were observed when responses to odors were compared to the responses to odorless stimuli. We conclude EEG recordings are suitable for detecting active processing of odors. As such they could be integrated in a BCI that strives to rehabilitate olfactory disabilities or uses odors for hedonistic purposes.","","978-1-6654-6329-4","10.1109/CNN56452.2022.9912520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912520","neurofeedback;BCI;olfaction;EEG","Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Recording;Task analysis;Neurotechnology;Neurofeedback","","1","","3","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on this previous study, we aimed to study whether olfactory stimuli can serve as contextual cues. We conducted behavioral experiments in which the participants were required to learn arm-reaching tasks in unfamiliar force fields. As contextual cues, we used odors of lemon and lavender, which have opposing functions: Lemon is believed to enhance mental or physical task performance, while lavender is considered to be a relaxant.

The proposed framework suggests a portable, easy to deploy noninvasive method to detect olfactory dysfunctions at the COVID test center. The validation of the parameters under clinical expertise has laid a ground to predict and proper assess of olfactory deficits in a patient within 20 minutes. The selection of hyper parameters was done using RBF kernel. The test is steered using a simple neuro-imaging, non-invasive device gathering the EBG waves, essentially gamma waves received from the olfactory nerve present in the upper nostril.

Five of the 67 cells tested had very brief monophasic action potentials and high spontaneous firing rates (30–80 Hz); it is suggested that these units were interneurons. The remainder of the neurons had broader spikes and did not discharge for prolonged periods. Thirty-nine percent of the broad spike cells responded to at least one and usually more of the odors presented to the rats during either of the first two trials on which that odor was present, but, in most cases, these responses occurred only very infrequently over the course of subsequent trials. Six percent of the broad-spike group, how ever, continued firing robustly to a single odor but not to others. From these results it appears that most cells in piriform cortex do not respond to most odors, i.e., coding is exceedingly sparse. A subgroup of the predominant broad-spike cell type does react to several odors but this response drops out with repeated exposure, perhaps because of training. However, a few members of this class (a small fraction of the total cell population) do go on responding to a particular odor, thus exhibiting a form of odor specificity. The results are discussed with regard to predictions from recently developed models of the olfactory cortex.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.1991.3.3.293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793891","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2025.3566409","Next Generation Network for Neuroscience(grant numbers:MRC #MR/T046759/1,NSF #2014217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10994250","Metal oxide sensors;olfactory bulb;analog front-end;gas concentration","Sensors;Gas detectors;Sensor arrays;Olfactory bulb;Feature extraction;Neurons;Olfactory;Robot sensing systems;Gases;Sensor systems","","","","","IEEE","8 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First, roles of olfactory displays are categorized into three functions: making scented air from the stocked form of each odor material (vaporization), switching/blending multiple kinds of scents, and delivering scented air to the human olfactory organ. Next, detailed techniques in each category are described. A variety of techniques are applied in modern olfactory displays, each of which has both advantages and limitations.

This is recognized by museums seeking to move beyond the dominant visuocentric exhibition paradigm, broadening the spectrum of sensorial stimuli on offer. However, the delivery of olfactory experiences in a museum presents important and unique challenges, largely related to the odorant's physical nature, which impose constraints to the design of experiences that can reach the visitor with impact and efficacy. Here, we present an olfactory delivery device designed to address these issues, which was prototyped and implemented over a 10-year period as an integral element of a display dedicated to the culinary heritage of Singapore. The device was also utilized in two other exhibitions, with radically different purposes: in one case as an element of the indigenous natural and cultural heritage, and in the other as a comparison tool to provide an intuitive illustration of progress. The diverse subject matters covered, and the different approaches to the delivery of olfactory stimuli demonstrate the versatility of the olfactory device in a range of exhibit settings. The case studies presented indicate that olfactory experiences can be effectively integrated in local museums, but their inclusion demands additional processes and specific consideration. Growing interest in this area of exhibition design, consistent with a global trend to transform museums into multisensory environments, makes this an important field for further research.","2474-1485","978-1-4673-8993-8","10.1109/VSMM.2016.7863208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7863208","olfaction;museum;exhibition design;intangible heritage;memory","Olfactory;Visualization;History;Chemicals;Cultural differences;Collaboration","","7","","12","IEEE","28 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mimic the biological olfactory system, temperature modulation is first used to virtually increase the number of sensors by periodically sampling the sensors' response at different temperatures. A convex microhotplate is used in order to improve the thermal properties of the structure enabling efficient temperature modulation process to be carried out. Temperature modulation is shown to increase the number of effective sensors from 16 physically available sensors (integrated on a single chip) to 12 000 virtual sensors (VSs). This enables the emulation of a very large number of sensors typically found in biological systems. The response of each sensor is seen as a fingerprint map, which is further processed using various image processing techniques. Self organized maps (SOMs) algorithm is used to create a 2D map for each gas and to combine the huge number of VSs in order to reduce the dimensionality. Image moments are used as a feature enabling to characterize the spatial distribution within the image lattice and to retrieve the brighter regions in the SOM' nodes exhibiting high activity to the input gas.

A sample data source for AOS to detect pepper powder was built by collecting the odor data of the condiment powders under different origins and adulteration conditions using the sensor array of the PEN3 electronic nose system (AIRSENSE, Germany). Then, machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, decision tree and random forest were introduced to form the intelligent models to evaluate the quality of the pepper powder from different origins and with different adulterated substances. The results indicated that the recognition accuracy reached to over 98% for all types of pepper samples with the radial basis function-support vector machine (RBF-SVM) model. The pure pepper could be distinguished from the adulterated samples successfully with the accuracy of near 100% using machine leaning models. Finally, other more machine learning algorithms were compared to recognize the states of different pepper powders. The results showed that the SVM method has the highest accuracy in classifying the adulteration of pepper powder among different machine learning models discussed in the research. It is feasible to detect and recognize the quality of the food seasoning with AOS based on machine learning algorithms and sensor array.","1941-0123","","10.1109/MIM.2022.9955467","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:21808181,61903164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9955467","","Support vector machines;Powders;Machine learning algorithms;Sensitivity;Soft sensors;Olfactory;Sensor systems","","3","","10","IEEE","18 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Bootstrapping is implemented for the optimized networks, providing an accurate estimate of a network's predicted values. Initially a simple linear predictor was used to assess the complexity of the data and was found to provide low prediction performance. A nonlinear ANN in the form of a single multilayer perceptron (MLP) was also used, providing a significant increase in prediction performance. The effect of the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of the MLP was investigated and found to be effective in enhancing network performance with both a single and a double hidden layer investigated separately. A hybrid array of MLPs was investigated and compared against the single MLP architecture. The hybrid MLPs were found to classify all vectors of the validation set, presenting the highest degree of prediction accuracy. Adjustment of the number of hidden neurons was investigated, providing further performance gain. In addition, noise injection was investigated, proving successful for certain network designs. It was found that the best-performing MLP was that of the double-hidden-layer hybrid MLP network without the use of noise injection. Furthermore, the level of performance was examined when different numbers of OSNs used were varied from the maximum of 24 to only 5 OSNs. Finally, the ideal OSNs were identified that optimized network performance. The results obtained from this study provide strong evidence of the usefulness of ANNs in the field of olfaction for the future realization of a signal processing back end for an artificial olfactory biosensor.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797421","","","","7","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

We have therefore analyzed the effect of odor stimuli on the first odor-processing network in the honeybee brain, the antennal lobe, which corresponds to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We stained output neurons with a calcium-sensitive dye and measured across-glomerular patterns of spontaneous activity before and after a stimulus. Such a single-odor presentation changed the relative timing of spontaneous activity across glomeruli in accordance with Hebb's theory of learning. Moreover, during the first few minutes after odor presentation, correlations between the spontaneous activity fluctuations suffice to reconstruct the stimulus. As spontaneous activity is ubiquitous in the brain, modifiable fluctuations could provide an ideal substrate for Hebbian reverberations and sensory memory in other neural systems.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976606774841558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790359","","","","2","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The mechanisms and properties of the temporal coding remain undetermined, although it has been postulated that oscillations can mediate formation of this type of code. Here we use a generic model of the vertebrate olfactory bulb to explore the possible role of oscillatory behavior in temporal coding. We show that three mechanisms—synaptic inhibition, slow self-inhibition and input properties—mediate formation of a temporal sequence of simultaneous activations of glomerular modules associated with specific odorants within the oscillatory response. The sequence formed depends on the relative properties of odorant features and thus may mediate discrimination of odorants activating overlapping sets of glomeruli. We suggest that period-doubling transitions may be driven through excitatory feedback from a portion of the olfactory network acting as a coincidence modulator. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the period-doubling transition transforms the temporal code from a roster of odorant components to a signal of odorant identity and facilitates discrimination of individual odorants within mixtures.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.2006.18.4.794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6795499","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The robot was also equipped with a male or female voice, to better counteract odor-related gender differences. Thirty participants engaged in storytelling sessions with NAO under different sensory conditions. Our findings indicate odors significantly affecting trust, especially when resembling female pheromones. Conversely, odors had a nuanced influence on RE, despite participants reporting greater CoPre than SoPre. Additionally, a bidirectional relationship between SoPre and trust emerged, reinforced by sensory congruence. These results highlight the significance of sensory alignment in shaping socio-relational and trust dynamics and emphasize the potential of olfactory stimuli in enhancing human-robot interactions.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Attention-Based Dense Spatial-Temporal Model (MSADM). This model leverages temporal attention, multi-scale dense feature extraction, and attention-based feature fusion to effectively capture and enhance the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies within EEG data, thereby improving the representations. Furthermore, we introduce a new olfactory-based emotion induction paradigm, which effectively mitigates the limitations of traditional visual and auditory stimuli by providing more stable and sustained emotional responses. We also present a novel EEG dataset involving 32 subjects, developed through a pilot study to select appropriate olfactory stimuli. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and emotion induction paradigm.

Prefrontal cortex is the prominent cortical structure to which the MDT is connected. Measuring stress, attention and drowsiness levels and developing proper courses of action to improve the performance and productivity is greatly facilitated by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG). Reading is one of the principal information acquisition methods for human brain. Cortical mapping plays a very important role in strengthening the memory circuit connections in the brain. While reading, if words are capable of evoking corresponding visuals, it will cause to the creation of long term memory. This is how mnemonics work excellently in enriching one's vocabulary. High Alpha and Beta band powers of EEG signals are responsible for scaling up relaxation and attention levels of an individual respectively. In this paper major focus is placed on how an olfactory stimulus alters the strength of beta band oscillations of the prefrontal cortex. Along with that we discuss the way fragrance nature of environment, incense burning and synthetic perfume, affects the relaxation levels (Alpha band power) and the attention levels (Beta band power) of a subject by collecting EEG signals from primary visual cortex during a reading task of four minutes. Alpha and Beta band powers are drastically low in case of synthetic perfume fragrance compared to incense burning ambience.","","978-1-5090-1746-1","10.1109/SPCOM.2016.7746640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746640","","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Visualization;Oscillators;Band-pass filters;Neurotransmitters;Central nervous system","","","","23","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular comments are given on the possiblity of improving sensors arrays performances through both a better material quality control of the single sensing element and a deeper attention to noise matching conditions for getting a better resolution. A number of data analysis methods can be utilized to process sensors arrays data, among them self organized neural networks have been proven to provide substantial improvements. One of the most important feature of the olfaction of the mammalians is its non statical behaviour. The dynamics of the olfactory bulb (which is the neuronal structure incharged to preprocess the olfactory receptors signals) seems to play a fundamental role in odour recognition. From this consideration a number of new data analysis methods can arise providing a substantial improvement to sensors arrays applications.","","286332182X","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5435870","","Sensor arrays;Chemical sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Chemical analysis;Olfactory;Data analysis;Image analysis;Quality control;Working environment noise;Neural networks","","","","22","","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These difficulties are mainly due to the mechanism of human olfaction, in which a set of so-called ""primary odors"" has not been found. Instead, we focus on spatio-temporal control of odor rather than synthesizing odor itself. Many existing interactive olfactory displays simply diffuse the scent into the air, which does not provide the ability of spatio-temporal control of olfaction. Recently, however, several researchers have developed olfactory displays that inject scented air under the nose through tubes. On the analogy of visual displays, these systems correspond to head-mounted displays (HMD). These yield a solid way to achieve spatio-temporal control of olfactory space, but they require the user to wear something on his or her face. Here, we propose an unencumbering olfactory display that does not require the user to attach anything on the face. It works by projecting a clump of scented air from a location near the user's nose through free space. We also aim to display a scent to the restricted space around a specific user's nose, rather than scattering scented air by simply diffusing it into the atmosphere. To implement this concept, we used an ""air cannon"" that generates toroidal vortices of the scented air. We conducted a preliminary experiment to examine this method's ability to display scent to a restricted space. The results show that we could successfully display incense to the target user. Next, we constructed prototype systems. We could successfully bring the scented air to a specific user by tracking the nose position of the user and controlling the orientation of the air cannon to the user's nose.","1087-8270","0-7803-8415-6","10.1109/VR.2004.1310054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310054","","Olfactory;Displays;Nose;Humans;Control system synthesis;Solids;Scattering;Atmosphere;Prototypes;Target tracking","","74","1","28","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we investigated how these factors influence EEG effective connectivity among the mentioned brain regions during emotional olfactory stimuli. To this aim, we acquired EEG data from twenty-one healthy volunteers, during a passive odor task of odorants with different valence. We used Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for EEG and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) to investigate the modulatory effects of odors’ valence on the connectivity strengths of the PC-EC-OFC network. Moreover, we controlled for the influence of arousal and gender on such modulatory effects. Our results highlighted the relevant role of the forward and backward PC-EC connections in odor’s brain processing. On the one hand, the EC-to-PC connection was inhibited by both pleasant and unpleasant odors, but not by the neutral one. On the other hand, the PC-to-EC forward connection was found to be modulated (posterior probability (Pp)>0.95) by the arousal level associated with an unpleasant odor.

One of the main problems in the conventional olfactory display is that the odorants emitted from the device not only reach the nose but spread into the ambient air, so that the user experience may be changed by the remaining odor. To solve this problem, we have developed a newly structured olfactory display which utilizes human respiratory action. In the method, DC fan is driven to create an odor stream in front of the nostril. Thus, odor goes through the nostril only when the user sniffs it. The odor plume generation is based on the combination of SAW atomizer with micro dispensing valve. We have fabricated a prototype, and then evaluated the waste odor emitted into the air using a commercially available gas detector.

It depends on types of temporal fluctuation of constituent odor intensity what kinds of limit cycle attractors are formed under application of mixed odor stimulation.

HTM is a broad paradigm for pattern recognition and forward prediction that exploits the hierarchy in time and space existing in the physical world during both learning and inference. In this paper we focus on HTM's capabilities for pattern recognition. We applied HTM to an electronic nose system to discriminate four typical volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Feature vectors were input into the HTM learning algorithm, which were extracted from the sensor array response data, to investigate its generalization capability for olfactory information process. In comparison with the traditional pattern recognition method support vector machine, our experimental results show that the HTM algorithm has a good performance in classification of these VOCs. Its robust generalization capability is suitable for electronic nose applications to process the time series signals from sensor arrays.","","978-1-4673-1184-7","10.1109/BMEI.2012.6513154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513154","hierarchical temporal memory;pattern recognition;electronic nose","","","3","","7","IEEE","4 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We define a topology graph for each region, that describes the topological skeleton of the region's boundary surface and that shows between which contours the surface patches should be generated. We provide a graph-directed triangulation algorithm to reconstruct surface patches between contours. We combine our graph-directed triangulation algorithm together with a piecewise parametric curve fitting technique to ensure that abutting or shared surface patches are precisely coincident.

The existing multi-odor presentation methods in VR are mostly based on spatiality of scent sources to produce mixed scents, which will possibly compromise users’ olfactory experience because humans normally have poor ability to analyze distinct odorant components from a mixture. To tackle this problem, we present a VR multi-odor display approach that dynamically changes the intensity combinations of different scent sources in the virtual environment according to the user’s attention, hence simulating a virtual cocktail party effect of smell. We acquire the user’s gaze information as attention from the eye-tracking sensors embedded in the head mounted display (HMD), and increase the display intensity of the scent that the user is focusing on to simulate the cocktail party effect of smell, enabling the user to distinguish their desired scent source. We conducted a user study to validate the perception and experience of 2 ways of intensity settings in response to the user’s attention shift, which were a strong level of focused scent mixed with weak levels of non-focused scents and strong focused scent only. The results showed that both of the two intensity settings were able to improve olfactory experience in VR compared to the non-dynamic odor display method. Meanwhile, only the method of presenting strengthened focused scent while maintaining the weaker mixture of background scents showed significant improvement on simulating the olfactory cocktail party effect by giving the users an enhanced sense of their own olfactory sensitivity.","2642-5254","978-1-6654-9617-9","10.1109/VR51125.2022.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756744","virtual reality;odor presentation;attention","Sensitivity;Three-dimensional displays;Conferences;Olfactory;Virtual environments;Focusing;Resists","","5","","39","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simple Normalization of data in the scale [0, 1] without attributing special importance to specific sub-intervals in [0, 1] results in significant loss in information, which cannot be retrieved otherwise to identify the proposer class of a given data point. This paper attempts to represent n-dimensional data point patterns into quantized fuzzy vectors of 3n dimensions. As the class information for all the data points of the training instances are known, a majority voting over (the individual quantized fuzzy) components of the data points in a class effectively returns an approximate centroidal measure of the data points lying in the same class. The concatenation of such majority-voted components of the data points in a class represents the class centroid of the respective class. The class centroids thus obtained are saved to determine the class of an unknown data point. The classification of an unknown data point here is performed in two steps. First the unknown data point is quantized in fuzzy space similarly as for the training data, and the resulting quantized fuzzy vector is projected along all the unit class centroid vectors of all known classes. In case the projection along the k-th unit class centroid vector is the largest, then the class of the unknown data point is regarded as k. The proposed principle has successfully been applied in classification of olfactory stimuli from the acquired EEG signals of the subjects and the classification performance is found to be superior with respect to the existing state-of-the art algorithms.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944662","Fuzzy vector quantization;olfactory perception;classification;electroencephalography","Training;Electroencephalography;Fuzzy sets;Vector quantization;Feature extraction;Olfactory","","2","","21","IEEE","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, we found that atomization capability of the SAW atomizer deteriorated in a few tens of seconds after the start of driving the SAW atomizer. We hypothesized that SAW velocity change due temperature change of SAW device caused resonant frequency shift. Therefore, we constructed frequency correction system using a FPGA.

Subsequently, a comprehensive feature extraction process was conducted, covering time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear attributes. These extracted features were then input into three different machine learning classifiers to independently discern emotional Valence and arousal levels within the OVR context. The results showed a classification recognition rate ranging from 68.18% to 82.61% in the OVR scenarios, indicating the ECG's sensitivity to reflecting the emotion recognition effects induced by OVR.

Other studies have developed probabilistic strategies; but few have explored the combination of both. In this study, we analyze a probabilistic strategy known as infotaxis. Here, we find a case where if the size of the searching agent increases, relative to the width of the environment, the performance of infotaxis decreases. To compensate for this disadvantage, we propose a hybrid algorithm. The hybrid algorithm starts an olfactory search with infotaxis and switches to a silk moth-mimetic algorithm when the agent is nearby the source and the signal of odor pulses is periodic. We evaluated the performance of the hybrid algorithm by simulations under video recordings of real odor plumes. As a result, we found that the hybrid algorithm significantly improved the success rate at the agent size that decreased the performance of infotaxis.","2325-033X","978-1-6654-3899-5","10.1109/UR52253.2021.9494650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494650","","Correlation;Biological system modeling;Olfactory;Probabilistic logic;Industrial facilities;Airports;Sensors","","","","12","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed EEG cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between frontal to left vs. right temporal regions during exposure to fragrances of varying subjective pleasantness. Our results show that higher-pleasantness fragrances gave rise to right-Iateralized θ - γ coupling and left-lateralized α - γ coupling, which likely represent memory processing and emotional processing respectively. Regression models reveal that fragrance pleasantness exhibits a linear relationship with θ - γ laterality, but a nonlinear relationship with α - γ laterality. These findings illustrate the significant role that CFCs play in long-distance neural communication in olfactory perception.

Increasing the discriminability of such odorants through learning is challenging, as learning-related plasticity in neurons activated by one such odorant then many inappropriately alter the representations of similar, overlapping odorants. We here describe a transfer learning algorithm, based on mammalian olfactory bulb architecture and asymmetric STDP, in which interneurons construct experience-dependent higher-order receptive fields (HORFs) that become diagnostic of more complex odorant signatures (covariance patterns). Consequently, even highly similar odorants can evoke nonoverlapping ensembles of interneurons, and thereby independently regulate principal neuron spike timing patterns and prevent the cross-contamination of plasticity. HORF construction is regulated by parameters such as maximum synaptic weight, initial connection probabilities, and the interneuron membrane time constant and spike threshold. This core algorithm can in principle allocate inhibition so as to regulate generalization and discrimination among specific odorant representations.","","978-1-5090-2392-9","10.1109/ISOEN.2017.7968869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968869","","Olfactory;Sociology;Statistics;Neurons;Training;Biomembranes;Timing","","6","","7","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The probability density function of the inter-spike intervals exhibits a Poisson-type behavior with a maximum located at time lags around 600 ms. Such a value agrees well with the frequency of the theta rhythm observed in the visual cortex of mammals, in particular, rabbits. EEGs were recorded from 8/spl times/8 arrays of subdural electrodes at high density (6/spl times/6 mm) in rabbits trained to discriminate visual stimuli in a classical aversive paradigm. EEG patterns had the form of amplitude and phase modulation of this. The covariance between the spatial events revealed striking peaks in the theta range (2-7 Hz), even when the autospectrum of the EEG failed to show a prominent peak. Comparable sequences of spatial EEG patterns in the olfactory system occur at frequencies in the theta range, reflecting the driving by respiration. These multiple sets of observation suggest that the visual system may be driven by surges of sensory input that are occasioned by saccades. Further studies are indicated to analyze this relationship by cross correlating simultaneous recordings of saccades and scalp EEGs from the occipital leads.","1098-7576","0-7803-7044-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2001.939517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939517","","Electroencephalography;Frequency;Rabbits;Humans;Probability density function;Rhythm;Electrodes;Phase modulation;Olfactory;Visual system","","2","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Solution exchange, which is to refresh the absorbed odorant from OR, was implemented by continuous flow of a buffer solution, driven by suction force of superabsorbent polymer. Note that no electricity is required for the exchange system. To demonstrate the solution exchange, a biological nanopore was reconstituted in the membrane, and blocking phenomena was observed using hepta-6-sulfato-β-cyclodextrin.

The moving direction of each robot is given by minimization of a free energy separately. An internal “temperature” allows active control on the exploration/exploitation balance during the search.

A challenge is efficient partition of gaseous samples to the aqueous solution where the cell-based sensors reside. In this paper, we developed a device with a gas-flow channel, which allowed inflow of gaseous odorants over a well filled with aqueous solution.

Our hypothesis is that the human cognition is profoundly different from other forms of animal cognition primarily because the human cognition is mostly guided by sight, while animal cognition is widely guided by olfaction. Olfactory perception, which is different from sight, is characterized by a hedonic and affective quality which embodies the perception, inducing a restriction of the decision making range. This means that the olfactory-centric organisms use affection as a medium between perception and cognition. On the contrary, visual perception is less embodied and visual objects often need to be interpreted. This could thus pose as a probable reason as to why visuo-centric organisms, such as humans, developed another medium between perception and behavior, namely productive thinking. This paper will offer elements to elaborate a more complex theoretical framework concerning the relation between the olfactory system, perception of the living environment, olfaction-related behaviors, and decision making.","2380-7350","978-1-5386-7094-1","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2018.8639940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639940","olfaction;decision making;perception;emotion;productive thinking","Olfactory;Decision making;Organisms;Visualization;Cognition;Organizations;Visual perception","","3","","20","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study advances VR immersion by linking olfactory and visual elements using multimodal AI models and sophisticated segmentation. Using CLIP with 115 olfactory labels from the OlfactionBase dataset, prompts were framed to enhance scent-focused recognition, though CLIP's limitations highlighted the need for olfactory-specific training. 360° panoramic scenes were generated using ADE20K scene descriptions refined by GPT-4o mini, and processed with Skybox AI to create diverse immersive visuals. By segmenting images with scent labels, specific odors were mapped to regions within the virtual environment.

Therefore, the incidence of leakage in gas cylinders needs to be considered, in order to avoid fire, poisoning, and even death to those around it. Olfactory mobile robot can be used to detect gas content. Thus, the source of the gas leak in the industry and in the storage area for LPG gas cylinders can be identified. This paper emphasizes on robot navigation by using Machine Vision System (MVS) to speed up the process of finding the exact location of the gas leak source. Several tests were carried out on several aspects. The test results on the motor drivers show that the robot can move well. While the MVS testing shows that the programming algorithm for image processing is able to recognize track borders. Then, the results on gas sensors testing show that the robot can find the source of the gas leak and can adjust it to the required robot speed. The last test, which is on the whole system, shows that the duration needed to find the source of the gas leak is in accordance with the distance from the source of the gas leak.","2640-6535","978-1-7281-7523-2","10.1109/ICSIMA50015.2021.9526330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526330","olfactory mobile robot;navigation system;machine vision system","Image recognition;Navigation;Tracking;Machine vision;Olfactory;Programming;Robot sensing systems","","2","","8","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that optimizing this index over the controllable operating parameter namely ß (i.e., the operating temperature) of a single sensor will allow maximizing the spread of the odor-class prototypes (i.e., the class centers) in the feature space so that a better discrimination of odorants will be possible. We demonstrate on a sample dataset that finely tuning the operating temperature of a metal oxide sensor based on the suggested criterion not only yields a substantial improvement in classification performance but also warns about the existence of temperatures that cause a total confusion in the odor discrimination.","1930-0395","978-1-4244-4548-6","10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5398579","","Temperature sensors;Olfactory;Information theory;Sensor arrays;Probability distribution;Chemical sensors;Sensor systems;Drives;Gas detectors;Optimization methods","","2","","15","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this research gap, our team has developed a system that allows users to receive both visual and olfactory feedback simultaneously. Specifically, within the virtual environment, the system controls an odor diffuser to release a scent when the user reaches a specific location. This study aims to explore the delay tolerance interval of visual and olfactory feedback by adjusting the timing of the odor diffuser. Additionally, we will analyze the user experience feedback from different groups and use the collected data to establish an optimal delay feedback model.

We study a novel strategy for encoding intensity-invariant stimulus identity that is based on representing relative rather than absolute values of stimulus features. For example, in what is known as the primacy coding model, odorant identities are represented by the conditions that some odorant receptors are activated more strongly than others. Because, in this scheme, odorant identity depends only on the relative amplitudes of olfactory receptor responses, identity is invariant to changes in both intensity and monotonic nonlinear transformations of its neuronal responses. Here we show that sparse vectors representing odorant mixtures can be recovered in a compressed sensing framework via elastic net loss minimization. In the primacy model, this minimization is performed under the constraint that some receptors respond to a given odorant more strongly than others. Using duality transformation, we show that this constrained optimization problem can be solved by a neural network whose Lyapunov function represents the dual Lagrangian and whose neural responses represent the Lagrange coefficients of primacy and other constraints. The connectivity in such a dual network resembles known features of connectivity in olfactory circuits. We thus propose that networks in the piriform cortex implement dual computations to compute odorant identity with the sparse activities of individual neurons representing Lagrange coefficients. More generally, we propose that sparse neuronal firing rates may represent Lagrange multipliers, which we call the dual brain hypothesis. We show such a formulation is well suited to solve problems with multiple interacting relative constraints.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco_a_01175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668726","","","","1","","","Traditional","17 Mar 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, traditional nasal sprays often fail to deliver enough medication to this specific area. We present a laminar fluid ejection (LFE) method for precise delivery of medications to the olfactory cleft. Using a 3D-printed model of the nasal passages, we determined the precise velocity and angle of insertion needed to deposit fluid at the olfactory cleft. Then, we conducted three proof-of-concept in-vivo imaging studies to confirm olfactory delivery in humans. First, we used Technetium-99 (a radiolabeled tracer) and methylene blue (a laboratory-made dye) to visualize olfactory deposition. Both tracers showed successful deposition. In a separate study, we used functional MRI (fMRI), to compare our LFE method with a conventional nasal spray while delivering insulin. From the fMRI results, we qualitatively observed focal decreases in brain activity in prefrontal cortex following insulin delivery. Overall, these preliminary results suggest that LFE offers a targeted approach to olfactory drug delivery, opening opportunities for access to the brain.Clinical and Translational Impact Statement - Focal deposition at the olfactory cleft is a promising target for delivering medication to the brain.

The system consists of a gas sensor and an odor generator. The sensor measures the concentration variations of a gaseous chemical compound wafting in the air. The odor generator presents the user with an odor with amplified concentration variations. Thus, the user of the olfactory assist system can virtually have an enhanced sense of smell. The odor with four different intensities is generated by the current olfactory assist mask system. We first describe the experiments conducted to confirm that the subjects can surely discriminate the different intensities of the presented odor.

This study attempts to explore a potentially more generalized approach by looking into the connectivity patterns in the brain during olfactory sensing. Human olfactory system collects odorants and transduces them into neural signals which are transmitted to the olfactory bulb that connects to the orbitofrontal cortex for further processing. We study connectivity of cortex signal through the coherence analysis on scalp EEG data. We propose a novel protocol for robust olfactory stimulus identification and synchronization experiment. We adopt Magnitude Squared Coherence Estimation for coherence analysis and derived a coherence index (CI) to infer the collaborative effect derived from a region of interest, e.g., left side and right side of scalp. From the 14 subjects' EEG data, we observe the lateralization effect of olfactory processes in the human brain.

In particular, the deployment of practical efficient means to detect hidden persons and illegal substances at border crossing points is instrumental in avoiding terrorism, human trafficking or smuggling. This study presents the concept of an orthogonal"" approach to the identification of gas traces identified as pertinent targets for illicit substances (drugs and explosives) as well as for human presence. The techniques employed to perform the analysis are based on completely different physical principles, these are the Mid-Infrared photo-acoustic spectroscopy (MIR-PAS - demonstration of a novel widely tunable integrated MIR source coupled with a miniature photo-acoustic cell) and the Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) using a non radio-active ionization source. Definition of the pertinent compounds and their ""spectral signature"" (characterized with recording of the vapour phase IR properties via GC-FTIR and GC-MS), lead to a database of the target substances, the IR wavelengths were selected based on the individual target. For the case of human presence, volatile fatty acids (VFA) present in human sweat identified as ideal targets for remote detection of hidden persons, for example some VFAs are human specific, such as HMHA and 3MHA. The aforementioned VFAs are also active in the MIR range. Similarly for the case of the illicit drugs targeting has been based on their emitted VOCs depending on the type of substance (e.g. alkaloid drugs associated with their volatile degradation products etc), during this study, characterization of the cannabis markers lead to the identification of a new marker (under revision for European patent). For explosives substances volatile taggants are mainly associated with VOCs available during their preparation. In total 58 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in this study as candidates for the detection of Humans (31), Illegal Drugs (19), and Explosives (13). The aforementioned spectral database has been employed for algorithm selection and training, the algorithms used were the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Partial Least Squares -- Discrimant Analysis (PLS -- DA) and the k -- Nearest Neighbour (KNN), the results are very promising reaching levels of matching during training up to 98%. These algorithms will fuse the data collected and analysed by the two powerful techniques selected as the components of this ≪ orthogonal ≫ approach to the detection of the aforementioned gas traces. Target specific cavitand receptors were developed for the pre-concentrator procedure that increase the concentration of the gas trace in quest. During this work, improvement to the pre-concentration configuration has reduced the required time for the pre-concentration procedure significantly (10s of seconds compared to several minutes), this is part of the novelties developed during this study. IMS studies for detection of human presence has shown very promising results, recording levels of human specific gas traces after 15 minutes of a human present in an area of 50m3. This is very important considering that in most cases the people illegaly immigrating are confined in much smaller spaces and for very much longer periods (most of the times are more than one person too) which leads to increased concentration and abundance of the related VOCs hence, the instrument will definetely perform better. A miniaturized MIR-PAS has been developed supported by an array of DFB-QCLs that allows for this instrument to be a portable solution for operators at border points, assisting their daily activities and increase their performance. This is a powerful and promising tool to detect a very wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).","","978-1-4799-6364-5","10.1109/JISIC.2014.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975614","Border security;Orthogonal Technologies;IMS;MIRPAS;Human Detection;Illicit Drugs;Explosives;Olfactory;Mobile Instrument","Drugs;Security;Instruments;Explosives;Algorithm design and analysis;Olfactory;Europe","","2","","","IEEE","6 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although several studies on visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory displays have been conducted, gustatory displays have seldom been studied. This scarcity has been attributed to the fact that synthesizing arbitrary taste from basic tastants is difficult. On the other hand, it has been noted that the perception of taste is influenced by visual cues, auditory cues, smell, the trigeminal system, and touch. In our research, we aim at utilizing this influence between modalities for realizing a ""pseudo-gustatory"" system that enables the user to experience various tastes without changing the chemical composition of foods.

Metal Oxide (MOx) sensors show high sensitivities for specific gases, which makes them particularly useful for such monitoring applications. However, how to efficiently sample and further process the sensor responses remains an open question. Here we propose a simple analog circuit design inspired by the spiking output of the mammalian olfactory bulb and by event-based vision sensors. Our circuit encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between the pulses of two separate pathways. We show that in the setting of controlled airflow-embedded gas injections, the time difference between the two generated pulses varies inversely with gas concentration, which is in agreement with the spike timing difference between tufted cells and mitral cells of the mammalian olfactory bulb. Encoding concentration information in analog spike timings may pave the way for rapid and efficient gas detection, and ultimately lead to data- and power-efficient monitoring devices to be deployed in uncontrolled and turbulent environments.","2766-4465","979-8-3503-0026-0","10.1109/BioCAS58349.2023.10388752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388752","Metal Oxide Sensors;Olfactory Bulb;Gas con detection;Spike time encoding","Gases;Sensitivity;Neuromorphics;Circuits and systems;Metals;Vision sensors;Olfactory bulb","","3","","36","IEEE","18 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of the fly's connectome using a powerful toolkit of well-developed genetic techniques and advanced electrophysiological recording tools enables the fly's neural circuitry to be experimentally mapped into functional units, called Local Processing Units (LPU). Many tools are already available to enable neuroscientists to create an accurate model of the entire fly brain, but none of them provides a method to specify those circuits in a way that both biologists and engineers can work together. Also, the development of plausible LPU models requires the ability to specify and instantiate subcircuits without explicit reference to their constituent neurons and internal connections. To this end, we present a neural circuit specification language called CircuitML for construction of LPUs. CircuitML has been designed as an extension to NeuroML; it provides constructs for defining subcircuits that comprise neural primitives supported by NeuroML. Subcircuits are endowed with interface ports that enable connections to other subcircuits via neural connectivity patterns.

For applications which require realistic representations of real world environments, the VEs need to provide multiple, physically accurate sensory stimuli. However, simulating all the senses that comprise the human sensory system (HSS) is a task that requires significant computational resources. Since it is intractable to deliver all senses at the highest quality, we propose a resource distribution scheme in order to achieve an optimal perceptual experience within the given computational budgets. This paper investigates resource balancing for multi-modal scenarios composed of aural, visual and olfactory stimuli. Three experimental studies were conducted. The first experiment identified perceptual boundaries for olfactory computation. In the second experiment, participants ($N=25$) were asked, across a fixed number of budgets ($M=5$), to identify what they perceived to be the best visual, acoustic and olfactory stimulus quality for a given computational budget. Results demonstrate that participants tend to prioritize visual quality compared to other sensory stimuli. However, as the budget size is increased, users prefer a balanced distribution of resources with an increased preference for having smell impulses in the VE. Based on the collected data, a quality prediction model is proposed and its accuracy is validated against previously unused budgets and an untested scenario in a third and final experiment.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2898823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642346","Multi-Modal;Cross-Modal;Tri-Modal;Sound;Graphics;Olfactory","Olfactory;Visualization;Computational modeling;Resource management;Mathematical model;Auditory system;Virtual environments","Acoustic Stimulation;Adult;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Female;Hearing;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Photic Stimulation;Psychophysics;Resource Allocation;Sensation;Smell;User-Computer Interface;Virtual Reality;Vision, Ocular;Young Adult","11","","45","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The poststimulus time (PST) histograms of single glomerular neurons on afferent electrical stimulation are monotonic, always with initial increase in induced pulse probability at varying latency of onset, implying that interactions are mutually excitatory. A differential equation is developed to represent the dynamics of afferent temporal dispersion and positive feedback in a neural population. The solutions of the equation are used to generate curves fitted to the PST histograms. The required numerical values for the coefficients are similar to those found for other bulbar neurons, which implies that the particular properties of neurons in the population arise-from the topology of connections and not from the single neurons.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.1974.324403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4120802","","Neurons;Olfactory;Feedback loop;Nerve fibers;Histograms;Passive optical networks;Differential equations;Central nervous system;Circuits;Negative feedback loops","Animals;Axons;Dendrites;Feedback;Humans;Interneurons;Mammals;Models, Biological;Models, Neurological;Neural Inhibition;Neurons;Olfactory Bulb;Synapses;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission","34","","34","IEEE","12 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Epoch intervals representing olfactory sensory perception were extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) signals using minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)-based single trial event related potential (ERP) approach to understand the evoked response to high pleasantness and low pleasantness stimuli. We found statistically significant changes in self reported stimuli evaluation between initial and final trials (p <; 0.05) for both stimuli categories. However, the changes in ERP amplitude were found to be statistically significant only for the high pleasantness stimuli.

The use of these methods provides insights into the temporal dynamics of EEG activity in both humans and experimental animals, and aids the study of the neuronal mechanisms that generate rhythmic EEG activity. Further the use of TF coherence analysts, which quantifies the consistency of phase relationships in multichannel EEG recordings, may contribute to the understanding of signal transmission between neuronal populations in different parts of the brain. We have used TF techniques to analyze the flow of activity patterns between two strongly connected brain structures: the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. Both of these structures are believed to be involved in information storage. By applying various frequencies of stimulation, we have found a peak in the spectral power in both sites at around 18 Hz, but the coherence between the EEG signals recorded from these sites was found to increase monotonically up to about 35 Hz. We have also found that long-term potentiation, a strong increase in the efficacy of excitatory synapses between these sites, either had no effect or decreased coherence.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.535247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=535247","","Monitoring;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Time frequency analysis;Humans;Animals;Signal analysis;Pattern analysis;Brain;Hippocampus","","28","","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We argue that only the latter view enables us to reach an objective mapping of the perception space. For color perception, we show how it is possible to derive objective maps of the perception space, just based on non-comparative verbal descriptions of color stimuli.

The novel MIP sensory system able detects gases selectively through an increase in electrical capacitance when the targeted mango gases are adsorbed on the sensor's surface. Each sensor will be first be calibrated by identifying the baseline value prior inserting the mango in the chamber. Once the mango is inserted, the capacitance shift on each sensor will help to determine different mango volatiles being emitted by mango and absorb by each of the sensor. The capacitance shift will be then calculated by an interface circuit to determine the level of mango maturity ranging from non ripe, semi ripe or ripe. By having an array of such sensors, with each IDE tuned to different unique volatiles, a robust and accurate fruit maturity determination can be performed.

The system allows you to create complex stimuli for the perception that the subject uses a visual, acoustic or olfactory system. For registration of biological signals earmarked voice recording and electroencephalogram (EEG). Since stimulus material acts on three different channels of human perception, in the biotechnical system includes means of visual, audio-visual and olfactory stimulation. All system components are integrated into the control unit shown in the form of a personal computer with pre-installed special software. A feature of the system work scenario is the registration sample speech only after the marked changes in the electroencephalogram caused by the perception of the appropriate stimulus. This approach increases the credibility of the sampling of speech, which can then be used to form the rules of recognition of types of emotions. With this system were formed multimodal database comprising 280 different russian speakers phrases and corresponding EEG recording. The goals of experiments are studies attribute spaces are invariant to the physical nature of the signal and adequately reflects the emotional response of the subject, and testing the hypothesis of invariance of attributes allocated to the national characteristics of speech signals. In order to study the dynamics of emotional response developed a method that allows to explore a variety of discrete portions of biological signals. The technique is based on the idea of shifting the window, which is carried out static analysis.

The architecture is a multi-layer spiking neural network, inspired by the structures of the insect brain mainly involved in the olfactory conditioning, namely the Mushroom Bodies, the Lateral Horns and the Antennal Lobes. The Antennal Lobes model is based on a competitive topology that transduces the sensorial information into a pattern, projecting such information to the Mushroom Bodies model. This model is based on a first and second order reaction-diffusion paradigm that leads to a spontaneous emerging of clusters. The Lateral Horns have been modeled as an input-triggered resetting system. The structure, besides showing the already known capabilities of associative learning, via a bottom-up processing, is also able to realize a top-down modulation at the input level, in order to implement an expectation-based filtering of the sensorial inputs.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-9637-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033456","","Neurons;Brain modeling;Biological system modeling;Olfactory;Computer architecture;Insects;Robot sensing systems","","6","","27","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to efficiently extract nonlinear features from high-dimensional data in the context of the IoMT while minimizing information distortion in data objects are challenging problems in recent academic research. A novel adaptive nonlinear feature extraction method via fruit fly olfactory neural network (Fly dimension expansion projection and remain main components by PCA, FDEPCA) is proposed, where 1) the data are mean-centered; 2) a binary sparse random projection matrix is used for dimension expansion projection; and 3) PCA is used to extract principal component information. The proposed method overcomes the problems of present nonlinear feature extraction in the face of high-dimensional outliers where the intrinsic geometric structure of the data is severely distorted and computationally expensive. The dataset after nonlinear feature extraction by the FDEPCA algorithm is applied to specific anomaly detection models, using ROC curves and AUC as evaluation metrics for classification performance. Extensive comparison experiments are conducted on eight publicly available datasets, and experimental results show that compared with the popular nonlinear feature extraction algorithms, the FDEPCA algorithm has better classification performance and projection time advantage. When applied to proximity-based, probability-based, and ensemble-based different anomaly detection models respectively, the FDEPCA algorithm exhibits strong applicability in different types of anomaly detection classifiers.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3318892","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172097,2020H6011,2021Y0008); Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262155","IoMT;Anomaly detection;Nonlinear feature extraction;Fruit fly olfactory neural network;Dimension expansion projection","Feature extraction;Kernel;Olfactory;Anomaly detection;Principal component analysis;Manifold learning;Classification algorithms","","","","","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To this end, we developed an olfactory-enhanced application in which an olfactory media synchronizes with a 5X5 matrix of images, 4 images being related to the synchronised scent.

Recognising such olfactory scenes could inform personal activity tracking, environmental monitoring, and assist robotic navigation. Yet it is unclear if current Metal-oxide (MOx) sensor technology is sensitive and specific enough to achieve this. Factors like sensor drift, and sensitivity to ambient humidity and temperature further complicate the recognition of olfactory scenes. Hotplate temperature modulation has been suggested as a method to counter these drawbacks. We present an electronic nose based on MEMS-MOx sensors that support rapid hotplate temperature modulation with a 150 ms period. We recorded different natural olfactory scenes in an urban context. A linear SVM was able to recognise four olfactory scenes in single hotplate cycles with near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same day, and 73% accuracy when tested in the same locations on the next day. Gas sensor responses yielded higher recognition accuracy than humidity, temperature, and pressure, which were also partly-location specific. Our results indicate that hotplate modulation enables recognition of natural odor scenes across extended timespans. These findings encourage the use of MOx-sensors as rapid sensing devices in natural, uncontrolled environments.","","978-1-6654-5860-3","10.1109/ISOEN54820.2022.9789654","MRC; NSF(grant numbers:MR/T046759/1,2014217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789654","Natural odor scene recognition;Metal oxide sensors;Hotplate modulation","Temperature sensors;Support vector machines;Heating systems;Temperature;Olfactory;Modulation;Humidity","","5","","9","IEEE","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is preferable to apply arousal assist for the driver instead of huge stimulus such as warning sound and vibration to the driver while driving. On the other hand, the effect of the scent is also reported as an environmental stimulus for driver. In this study, the seven kinds of scent were used as olfactory stimulation and the influence of scent on the driver's psychosomatic state was examined using a fixed-based driving simulator by measuring biological measurements including electrocardiogram and finger plethysmograph. As for brain activity of olfactory cortex, the multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (MNIRS) has been shown to enable the evaluation of changes in hemodynamic. The MNIRS was also used to monitor the activity of the frontal cortex as mirrored by hemodynamic responses subjected to olfactory stimulation.

However, the lingering nature of smell, as opposed to the transitory nature of other media objects that multimedia applications are accustomed to, such as video and audio, means that specific attention needs to be given when synchronising other media content with olfactory data. Results highlight the existence of two perceptual synchronisation regions for olfactory enhanced-multimedia applications.

Moreover they employ more than one type of cells. Being widely used in bio-inspired systems, Cellular Neural Networks are practical to implement large networks due to their regularly defined connections between unit processors. However, this perfect regularity of the structure does not always match with applications. Although it is widely selected for retina like demonstrations itself, there is an absence of CNN for using it in other bio-inspired systems: an ordinary CNN has only one type of unit processor in one layer. However, sensory data processing in nature mainly depend on the collaboration of distinct dynamics. Neural mass models are suggested to mimic the joint effort of distinct types of neurons and they are widely used to simulate and understand brain activity. The regularity of an ordinary CNN benefits in implementation of the network.

A recent development is the insertion of chemical sensors in mobile robots to track odor traces as well as to detect and declare odor sources. A major drawback of a chemical sensor for perceiving odors is the time it needs to recover its original state once saturated. Furthermore, when the source behaves as a constant gas leak, the presence of the odor is always increasing in the environment, saturating the sensors. The integration of chemical sensors into real-time mobile applications requires the smell perception system to desaturate them faster. This paper proposed an artificial nostril, inspired by nature, including the design of chambers to desaturate the sensors and the mathematical model. The main contribution is the implementation of the biologically inspired process of “ventilation” that bears in mind the sensor model as a cyclic behavior that includes three stages named inhalation, sampling, and exhalation.

Here, an interesting question arises in the context of evolution: how reactive agents could have evolved into cognitive ones with internalized memory? Our idea is that reactive agents with simple feedforward circuits could have achieved behavior comparable to internal memory if they can drop and detect external markers (e.g., pheromones or excretions) in the environment. We tested this idea in two tasks (ball-catching and food-foraging task) where agents needed memory to be successful. We evolved feedforward neural network controllers with a dropper and a detector, and compared their performance with recurrent neural network controllers. The results show that feedforward controllers with external material interaction show adequate performance compared to recurrent controllers in both tasks. This means that even memoryless feedforward networks can evolve behavior that can solve tasks requiring memory, when material interaction is allowed. These results are expected to help us better understand the possible evolutionary route from reactive to cognitive agents.","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2011.2132800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741011","Emergent behavior;environmental memory;neuroevolution;pheromone","Feedforward neural networks;Olfactory;Hippocampus;Neurons;Detectors;Memory management","","14","","54","IEEE","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method developed utilizes time series data from the dog's joint sensors (kinesthetic vector). Employing the same data, an experiment was set up to explore the above hypothesis, comparing the relative accuracy of classifying (discerning) the surface type experienced by the robot, both with and without the inclusion of a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators in the data processing stream. These experiments demonstrated a significant increase in classification rate (on average) when the sensory data was passed through a coupled oscillator system to precondition the signals prior to inputting to a PNN type neural network classifier, in comparison with the result obtained by feeding the data to the PNN without preconditioning. From an implementation point of view, it is significant that these results were obtained via a coupled oscillator whose inter-oscillator weights were randomly instantiated.

Using various search parameters, we conducted a thorough literature search in the online IEEE Xplore, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases for a time span of 15 years from 2007 to 2022 pertaining to the subject at hand. While the majority of research has employed commercially accessible EN devices and metal-oxide sensor (MOS), the most common classification techniques include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN), along with principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a feature transformation method. Therefore, this work will serve as a stepping stone for further research in the area of developing novel EN devices and ML algorithms for improving prediction tasks in the domains of healthcare, agriculture, and other allied domains.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2025.3547517","Department of Computer Science & Engineering of NIT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10909308","Electronic nose (EN);gas sensors;machine learning (ML);olfaction;volatile organic compounds (VOCs)","Sensors;Sensor arrays;Chemical sensors;Chemicals;Hardware;Gas detectors;Olfactory;Costs;Real-time systems;Agriculture","","","","204","IEEE","3 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Artificial neural network models abstract much of this complexity away and represent the computational process of neuronal groups in terms of simple point, and sometimes periodic attractors. But is this abstraction justified? Aperiodic dynamics are known to be essential in the formation of perceptual mechanisms and representations in biological organisms. Advances in neuroscience and computational neurodynamics are helping us to understand the properties of nonlinear systems that are fundamental in the self-organization of stable, complex patterns for perceptual, memory and other cognitive mechanisms in biological brains. Much of this new understanding of the principles of self organization in biological brains has yet to be modeled or used to improve the performance of autonomous robotic and virtual agents. In this paper we present a model of an autonomous agent learning appetitive/aversive behaviors using a neuronal group model capable of such aperiodic dynamics. We demonstrate how such dynamics are useful in the self-organization of perception and behavior, and discuss the use of aperiodic dynamics in the self-organization of cognitive mechanisms in autonomous agents.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307380","","Autonomous agents;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Biological systems;Neuroscience;Neurodynamics;Mechanical factors;Nonlinear systems","","1","","20","IEEE","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a hybrid approach that exploits neuromorphic computing in combination with probabilistic inference to address these demanding requirements. Our approach implements a combination of a convolutional spiking neural network for feature extraction and a Bayesian spiking neural network for odor detection and identification. The developed algorithm is rigorously tested on a dataset for sensor drift compensation for robustness evaluation.

In a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation, when subjects were instructed to remember and rate the pleasantness of a jasmin odor, activations were greater in the medial orbito-frontal and pregenual cingulate cortex than when subjects were instructed to remember and rate the intensity of the odor. When the subjects were instructed to remember and rate the intensity, activations were greater in the inferior frontal gyrus. These top-down effects occurred not only during odor delivery but started in a preparation period after the instruction before odor delivery, and continued after termination of the odor in a short-term memory period. Thus, depending on the context in which odors are presented and whether affect is relevant, the brain prepares itself, responds to, and remembers an odor differently. These findings show that when attention is paid to affective value, the brain systems engaged to prepare for, represent, and remember a sensory stimulus are different from those engaged when attention is directed to the physical properties of a stimulus such as its intensity. This differential biasing of brain regions engaged in processing a sensory stimulus depending on whether the cognitive demand is for affect-related versus more sensory-related processing may be an important aspect of cognition and attention. This has many implications for understanding the effects not only of olfactory but also of other sensory stimuli.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.2008.20128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793576","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, a limited number of studies have focused on the presentation of sensory spatial information. To artificially produce intranasal chemosensory spatial perception, we focused on a technique to induce intranasal chemosensation by transcutaneous electrical stimulation between the nasal bridge and the back of the neck. Whether this technique stimulates the trigeminal nerve or the olfactory nerve remains debatable; if this method stimulates the trigeminal nerve, the differences in the amount of stimulation to the left and right trigeminal branches would evoke lateralization of intranasal chemosensory perception. Therefore, we propose a novel method to lateralize intranasal chemosensation by selectively stimulating the left or right trigeminal nerve branches through the shifting of an electrode on the nasal bridge to the left or right. Finite element simulations reveal that electrical stimulation applied between the electrodes on the left/right nasal bridge and the back of the neck results in the construction of a high current density area on the left/right branch of the trigeminal nerve. The results of two psychophysical experiments reveal that intranasal chemosensation can be lateralized by using the proposed method. The results of our experiment also suggest that lateralization is not the result of electrically induced tactile sensation of the skin surface but rather due to the distribution of stimuli to the trigeminal nerves. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first successful lateralization of intranasal chemosensation that utilizes an easy-to-apply method without involving nostril blocking.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3322421","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) PRESTO(grant numbers:JPMJPR19J1); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)(grant numbers:21H03477); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273255","Chemesthesis;chemosensation;transcutaneous electrical olfactory stimulation;odor lateralization;olfactory display;pungent odor","Electrodes;Olfactory;Electrical stimulation;Current density;Chemicals;Chemotherapy","","1","","23","CCBYNCND","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to mimic biological olfactory rank codes, the features of gas sensors in an electronic olfaction system are ranked to form rank codes in our classifier instead of treating them as multidimensional data points. This classifier relies on probability rank tables, which are built for all target gases, because one-to-one mapping between the rank codes and the target gases is not practically found with the existing gas sensor technology. The table for each target gas records the probability of each sensor ID at each rank, and hence also serves as a visual interpretation tool. Due to the limited diversity in electronic olfaction system rank codes compared with biological olfactory codes, gas pairs are considered in this classifier by transforming the original multi-gas identification problem into pairwise classification problems in order to evaluate the discriminatory power between the rank codes for each pair of target gases. This discriminatory power at each rank not only helps to determine the applicability of the classifier but also serves as a weight for that rank in order to improve the classification performance. In addition, insightful quantitative feedback is integrated into the classifier in order to avoid misclassifications, and as a result, we achieve a 100% classification performance at the cost of a 3.79% rejection of uncertain predictions with a data set of an array of FIS inc. and Figaro inc. gas sensors exposed to five target gases.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2571342","Qatar National Research Fund through the National Priority Research Program(grant numbers:5-080-2-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475485","Gas sensor array;gas identification;probability rank table;rank codes;Gas sensor array;gas identification;probability rank table;rank codes","Gas detectors;Sensor arrays;Gases;Olfactory;Biological information theory;Visualization","","22","","28","IEEE","20 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results showed that the maximum resistance charge transfer (Rct) changes of two queen pheromone components [methyl p-hydroxy-benzoate (HOB) and vanillyl alcohol (HVA)] reached 60%, which were significantly higher than those of a bee larval pheromone component (ethyl oleate), and a floral volatile ( $\beta $ -ionone).

An artificial molecular communication network is created using biological molecules for encoding, transmitting and decoding the symbols to convey information. In addition to typical biological molecules, we are also exploring other classes of molecules that possess unique distinctive features which can be potentially exploited for establishing reliable communications. Odor molecules are one such class of molecules which possess several distinctive features such as Intensity, Headonic tone which provides a basis to convey the information in an olfactory communication system. In our work, we investigate the ICT (information and communication theory) perspective of the olfactory communications by evaluating the channel capacity of an odor molecular communication (OMC) system with the help of a novel modulation scheme viz. odor intensity shift keying (OISK), where information is being conveyed from the intensity level of an odor. Furthermore, we also analyse the effects of critical parameters like temperature and noise on the achievable channel capacity to provide an insight about the resilience of the proposed OMC system towards any such anomaly faced by it.","2332-7804","","10.1109/TMBMC.2024.3408063","AXA Research Fund (AXA Chair for Internet of Everything at Koç University); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10543154","Channel capacity;odor molecular communications;odor intensity waveform;gaussian distribution;molecular communication;advection-diffusion model","Receivers;Symbols;Olfactory;Mathematical models;Channel capacity;Atmospheric modeling;Transmitters;Molecular communication","","1","","52","IEEE","31 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the drive to integrate sensing and signal processing on chip continues, recent advancements emphasize the need for simple yet efficient pattern recognition systems. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention in the realm of machine olfaction for their high computational efficiency and biological realism, closely mirroring the human olfactory system’s approach to processing odors. Many studies have successfully applied SNN models for vapor classification; however, limited research exists on their use for concentration estimation. This article not only addresses this gap but also introduces a simple three-layer, multi-task shared SNN that simultaneously performs vapor recognition and concentration estimation using carbon black-polymer composite sensor arrays. Multi-task learning using SNNs proves particularly beneficial in this context by utilizing shared computations across tasks to optimize resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating both tasks into a single network enhances overall computational efficiency and reduces model complexity without sacrificing performance. Remarkably, this proof-of-concept design achieves a 33% reduction in the total number of neurons while performing 48% fewer synaptic operations per forward pass compared to two separate single-task SNNs. Logic synthesis further reveals that the shared approach consumes approximately 37% less power and occupies 37% less silicon area, showcasing the potential of multi-task learning with SNNs to propel artificial olfaction systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3541408","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10883967","Concentration estimation;electronic nose;gas recognition;machine olfaction;multi-task learning;spiking neural network","Polymers;Multitasking;Estimation;Olfactory;Sensor arrays;Spiking neural networks;Sensors;Carbon;Biology;Biological neural networks","","1","","60","CCBY","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a set of odor components that can cover a wide range of smells is not yet revealed, we study a selection of odor components using an essential-oil and food-flavor mass-spectrum database. Basis vectors are extracted by the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method, and then the nonnegative least-squares method is used to determine the recipe. To increase the approximation accuracy, two methods are proposed. One method is to increase the contributions of the samples with less frequent occurrence.

To improve the efficiency of the nonlinear block and to reduce the problem of massive interconnections in the KII network, a mixed-signal design to multiplex nonlinear blocks is proposed. Simulation results and chip measurement are presented for the reduced KII set.","","0-7803-7761-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1206443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206443","","Very large scale integration;Shape control;Analog computers;Computer networks;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Olfactory;Circuit synthesis;Computer architecture;Coupling circuits","","","","6","IEEE","20 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous studies, odorants were discriminated through arraying multiple types of sensors. However, the use of a sensor array enlarges the entire system and requires complex signal processing, which makes it difficult to mount the system on a quadcopter with limited payloads or an autonomous robot with low computational power. On the other hand, the antenna of an insect is composed of several olfactory receptors; thus, a single antenna responds to multiple odorants. Therefore, a system for discriminating between multiple odorants from the electroantennogram (EAG) signal of a single antenna of an insect is proposed. An antenna of an adult male silkmoth is employed; the silkmoth antenna exhibits an electric potential change when detecting an odor, but the difference in the EAG amplitude and recovery time depends on the type of odorant. Since EAG is a type of neural signal, it is difficult to perform odor discrimination by simply setting the threshold, because it drifts due to noise. Therefore, the Hodgkin-Huxley model (HH model) was applied to the raw EAG signal as a dynamic filter, and the spike firing rate of the output value was calculated using the HH model. Then, the odorants were discriminated against based on the magnitude of the spike firing rate. A series of signal processing was implemented in a microcontroller, and the experiments indicated that all antennae demonstrated a discrimination performance of 90$\%$ or more.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2020.3024606","Mitsubishi Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19K14943,JP19H02104,JP18H05467); National Bio-Resource Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200800","Chemical and biological sensors;electroantennogram (EAG);Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model;real-time odor discrimination","Antennas;Insects;Sensor arrays;Sensor systems;Antenna measurements;Electric potential","","1","","15","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The neural network architectures were analysed and tested with experimental data from an array of broadly tuned polymers gas sensors. Since these sensors are weakly selective, like the receptors of the natural system, the task of the networks is to obtain the selectivity enhancement that is needed to correctly discriminate the odours. The advantage of using ANN to classify data rather than statistical methods is that doesn't require many assumptions about the form of the data. In addition, ANN can cope with highly non linear data and can be made to cope with noisy or drifting data. The paradigms considered are Counterpropagation Networks (R. Hecht Nielsen, 1987), Bi directional Associative Memories (B. Kosko, 1988), Hamming (R.P. Lippmann, 1987), and Adaptive Resonance Theory Networks (G.A. Carpenter and S. Grossberg, 1988).

Not only do these people find it difficult to sense the aroma of food or perfume, but they are also unable to sense the odour of harmful gases if there is any gas leak in the surrounding environment. This inability to smell exposes them to multiple health hazards putting their life in danger. This paper discusses a portable device that can be used as an aid to detect the presence of dangerous gases with a warning system. Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), Methane (CH4), Butane (C4H1o), Carbon monoxide(CO) and Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) are the most common odored gases that are present in the surroundings, which are harmful to human health. These gases are widely used in household applications and industries and hence are commonly found. The device uses a gas detection system for monitoring the level of these gases and updates the values over the server from where it is made available to the user on a smartphone. Each sensor is calibrated to give accurate results, and the device uses Internet of Things (IoT) and an MQTT protocol to establish a network of all such users and plot the gas variations on the Map. It also includes vibrations, buzzers, and LEDs to indicate that a particular gas has crossed the threshold levels. The module is associated with an application that will continuously update the above-mentioned gases' values on the Android application and will send an alert through a notification and a text message with the individual's coordinates to the concerned individual during critical mishaps. Along with being compact and user-friendly, the device constitutes a rechargeable battery and also has applications in other fields.","","978-1-7281-6221-8","10.1109/INCET49848.2020.9154120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9154120","LPG;CO;Natural gas;Butane;Methane;Hydrogen Sulphide;Portable;Alerts;IoT;MQTT;Mapping;An-droid Application","Gases;Light emitting diodes;Olfactory;Methane;Vibrations;Androids;Humanoid robots","","5","","10","IEEE","3 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To design and optimize the next generation of neuronal implants while striving to minimize tissue damage, it is necessary to understand the mechanics of probe insertion at relevant length scales. Unfortunately, a broad-based understanding of brain-implant interactions at the necessary micrometer scales is largely missing. This paper presents a generalizable description of the micrometer-scale penetration mechanics and material properties of mouse brain tissue in vivo. Cylindrical stainless steel probes were inserted into the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb of mice. The effects of probe size, probe geometry, insertion rate, insertion location, animal age, and the presence of the dura and pia on the resulting forces were measured continuously throughout probe insertion and removal. Material properties (modulus, cutting force, and frictional force) were extracted using mechanical analysis. The use of rigid, incompressible, cylindrical probes allows for a general understanding of how probe design and insertion methods influence the penetration mechanics of brain tissue in vivo that can be applied to the quantitative design of most future implantable devices.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2003261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595682","Brain tissue in vivo mechanical properties;cutting forces;insertion forces;neuronal implants;soft tissue","In vivo;Probes;Material properties;Mice;Brain;Design optimization;Implants;Tissue damage;Steel;Cerebral cortex","Algorithms;Analysis of Variance;Animals;Biomechanics;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Dura Mater;Elastic Modulus;Mice;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Olfactory Bulb;Pia Mater;Poisson Distribution;Prostheses and Implants;Stainless Steel;Stress, Mechanical","132","1","31","IEEE","12 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an example in the case, this paper presents a bio-inspired analog gas sensing frontend for an artificial olfactory system. The analog front end implements a novel trainable feature extraction algorithm for metal-oxide gas sensor arrays.

We focus on a multi-user scenario where several transmitters wish to communicate with a central receiver. We assume that each transmitter employs a unique mixture of different types of signaling molecules to represent its message and the receiver is equipped with an array comprising  $R$  different types of receptors in order to detect the emitted molecule mixtures. The design of an MC system based on orthogonal molecule-receptor pairs implies that the hardware complexity of the receiver linearly scales with the number of signaling molecule types  $Q$  (i.e.,  $R=Q$ ). Natural olfaction systems avoid such high complexity by employing arrays of cross-reactive receptors, where each type of molecule activates multiple types of receptors and each type of receptor is predominantly activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with different activation strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is believed to discriminate several thousands of chemicals using only a few hundred receptor types, i.e.,  $Q\gg R$ . Motivated by this observation, we first develop an end-to-end MC channel model that accounts for the key properties of olfaction. Subsequently, we present the proposed transmitter and receiver designs. In particular, given a set of signaling molecules, we develop algorithms that allocate molecules to different transmitters and optimize the mixture alphabet for communication. Moreover, we formulate the molecule mixture recovery as a convex compressive sensing problem which can be efficiently solved via available numerical solvers. Finally, we present a comprehensive set of simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed MC designs revealing interesting insights regarding the design parameters. For instance, we show that mixtures comprising few types of molecules are best suited for communication since they can be more reliably detected by the cross-reactive array than one type of molecule or mixtures of many molecule types.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3242379","German Science Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:JA 3104/1-1); LOEWE initiative (Hesse, Germany) within the emergenCITY center; Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg through the Emerging Fields Initiative (EFI) program under project “Molecular Communications”.; DFG(grant numbers:SCHO 831/14-1); Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:MAMOKO (16KIS0913K)); FAU EFI program under project “Molecular Communications”; U.S National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1908308,CNS-2128448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036383","Engineered molecular communication;transmitter and receiver design;molecule mixture modulation;compressive sensing;odor;pheromone;generalist receptors","Chemicals;Olfactory;Modulation;Receivers;Transmitters;Interference;Electromagnetic compatibility","","7","","64","IEEE","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, on resource-constrained devices, BN cannot effectively estimate the mean and the variance of samples when training/fine-tuning with small batches of data, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the neural network. In the fruit fly olfactory system, the algorithm based on the “negative image” habituation model can filter redundant information and improve numerical stability. Inspired by the circuit mechanism, we propose a novel normalization method, habituation normalization (HN). HN first eliminates the “negative image” obtained by habituation and then calculates the statistics for normalizing. It solves the problem of accuracy degradation of BN when the batch size is small. Experiments show that HN can speed up neural network training and improve the model accuracy on vanilla LeNet-5, VGG16 and ResNet-50 in the Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Compared with four standard normalization methods, HN keeps stable and high accuracy in different batch sizes, which shows that HN has strong robustness, and is more suitable for neural network applications under limited computing power and memory.","","978-1-6654-9082-5","10.1109/ICICN56848.2022.10006573","Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006573","normalization;neural network training;resource constrained device;habituation;EEG signal application","Training;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Olfactory;Information filters;Generative adversarial networks;Stability analysis","","","","23","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional wildfire monitoring methods are hindered by inflexibility (e.g., watch towers) and cannot provide precise geo-location of wildfires (e.g., satellites). Thanks to recent development in robotics, deploying uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) to monitor wildfires has become a feasible solution. This article introduces a UAS-based wildfire monitoring system and implement it in a prescribed burn test. A multirotor UAS was employed as the search agent and carried both olfactory (i.e., carbon monoxide and particulate matter) and visual (i.e., a camera) sensors to detect the existence of wildfires. A fuzzy inference system is designed to fuse olfactory sensor outputs to estimate whether the UAS detects smoke. A deep learning model, i.e., You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4), is employed to identify smoke from the captured images. We deployed the proposed UAS in a prescribed burn at Tallahassee, Florida, in May 2022. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy inference system improves the estimation accuracy of whether the UAS detects smoke compared with the fixed threshold algorithm. In addition, the proposed YOLOv4 model can also detect smoke from captured images with a small amount of training samples.","","979-8-3503-3517-0","10.1109/UR57808.2023.10202419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202419","","Fuzzy logic;Atmospheric modeling;Olfactory;Fires;Cameras;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Inference algorithms","","6","","50","IEEE","8 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by this fact, we propose an easily implementable AL-like network and show that it significantly expedites and enhances the identification of odors from slow and noisy artificial polymer sensor responses. The device owes its efficiency to two intrinsic mechanisms: inhibition (which triggers a competition) and integration (due to the dynamical nature of the network). The former functions as a sharpening filter extracting the features of receptor signal that favor odor separation, whereas the latter implements a working memory by accumulating the extracted features in trajectories.

Sensory information is contained in the spatiotemporal synchronization pattern formed by the identities of the phase-locked PNs. This article investigates the role of feedback inhibition from the local neurons (LNs) in this coding. First, experimental biological results are reproduced with a reduced computational spiking neural network model of the AL. Second, the low complexity of the model leads to a mathematical analysis from which a lower bound on the phase-locking probability is derived. Parameters involved in the bound indicate that PN phase locking depends not only on the number of LN-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) previously received, but also on their temporal jitter. If the inhibition received by a PN at the current oscillatory cycle is both perfectly balanced (i.e., equal to the mean inhibitory drive) and precise (without any jitter), then the PN will be phase-locked at the next oscillatory cycle with probability one.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976605774320566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790363","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, how to evoke subjects’ emotions efficiently in EEG-related emotional experiments is still a challenge. In this work, we developed a novel experimental paradigm that allows odors dynamically participate in different stages of video-evoked emotions, to investigate the efficiency of olfactory-enhanced videos in inducing subjects’ emotions; According to the period that the odors participated in, the stimuli were divided into four patterns, i.e., the olfactory-enhanced video in early/later stimulus periods (OVEP/OVLP), and the traditional videos in early/later stimulus periods (TVEP/TVLP). The differential entropy (DE) feature and four classifiers were employed to test the efficiency of emotion recognition. The best average accuracies of the OVEP, OVLP, TVEP, and TVLP were 50.54%, 51.49%, 40.22%, and 57.55%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the OVEP significantly outperformed the TVEP on classification performance, while there was no significant difference between the OVLP and TVLP. Besides, olfactory-enhanced videos achieved higher efficiency in evoking negative emotions than traditional videos. Moreover, we found that the neural patterns in response to emotions under different stimulus methods were stable, and for Fp1, FP2, and F7, there existed significant differences in whether adopt the odors.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3253866","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972437); Excellent Youth Foundation of Anhui Scientific Committee(grant numbers:2208085J05); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0201502); Special Fund for Key Program of Science and Technology of Anhui Province(grant numbers:202203a07020008); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2108085MF207); Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2021KH0AB06); Open Projects Program of National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(grant numbers:202200014); Open Fund Project of Key Laboratory of Civil Aviation Flight Technology and Flight Safety(grant numbers:FZ2022KF15); Cloud Ginger XR-1; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063978","Electroencephalogram (EEG);emotion recognition;human–computer interface (HCI);olfactory-enhanced video;neural pattern","Electroencephalography;Emotion recognition;Brain;Human computer interaction;Physiology;Visualization;Olfactory","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Recognition, Psychology;Entropy","30","","50","CCBYNCND","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When an aircraft is flying close to the ground, the flow characteristics will be affected by the ground, the induced drag and wake volocity will be changed, which is called the wing-in-ground effect. The diffusion of odor plume under the wing-in-ground effect is different from the normal conditions. In this paper, the wing-in-ground effect is simulated by the opposite flow of two mirrored wakes. This method converts the influence of ground on wake vortexes into that of mirrored wake vortexes. Inspired by the PIV (particle image velocimetry) principle, a simple and easy-to-operate device that can be realized in the offices is designed and built to verify the accuracy of the simulation. The Hu invariant moments are used to compare the envelope lines of odor-plumes images in the simulation and experiment, and the results are converted into a number indicating the similarity between them.

A compact (4.5 cm × 5 cm × 2.2 cm) electronic nose, which is integrated with a tin-oxide gas-sensor array and capable of wireless communication with computers or mobile phones through Bluetooth, was implemented and characterized by using three different gases (ethanol, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen). During operation, the readout circuit digitizes the gas-sensor resistances into a concentration-independent spike timing pattern, which is unique for each individual gas. Both sensing and recognition operations have been successfully demonstrated in hardware. Two classification algorithms (rank order and spike distance) have been implemented. Both algorithms do not require any explicit knowledge of the gas concentration to achieve simplified training procedures, and exhibit comparable performances with conventional pattern-recognition algorithms while enabling hardware-friendly implementation.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2075928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682068","Electronic nose;gas sensors;neuromorphic engineering;olfactory system;spiking neurons","Arrays;Encoding;Timing;Gases;Sensors;Capacitors;Sensitivity","","48","","23","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, two types of AO effects, i.e. the lateral effect and the vertical effect, were summarized based on experimental phenomena. Secondly, the wake induced gas-patch path was calculated based on the prescribed wake model, and the AO effect was eliminated by estimating the original position of the detected gas patch through backstepping along the induced path. Thirdly, considering the different diffusion speeds along different directions, an ellipsoidal Gaussian distribution rather than the traditional spherical Gaussian distribution mapping method was put forward, which was validated via an experiment conducted using four wireless sensor nodes. The proposed AO-effect elimination algorithm combined with the ellipsoidal kernel GDM has been tested using a robot active olfaction simulator, and the results show that it is more effective in characterizing the gas distribution.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6390-3","10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9188643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9188643","Gas distribution mapping;three-dimensional;aero-olfactory effect;ellipsoidal kernel distribution mapping","Kernel;Rotors;Gas detectors;Three-dimensional displays;Gaussian distribution;Propellers;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","3","","18","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it may not always be suitable for extensive industrial sites that require continuous monitoring and swift results for timely remediation actions. Moreover, these sites necessitate solutions for identifying odour sources to ensure effective remediation or protect themselves from unwarranted claims.In Germany, a prominent feed production company specializing in poultry waste found a compelling need to enhance the real-time assessment of gas and odour emissions from its operations. The primary objective was to pinpoint potential sources and instances of olfactory nuisances that could affect nearby communities. The production facility is situated in close proximity to residential areas, resulting in a considerable number of complaints. Facing these circumstances, the company lacked the tools necessary to quantify or identify the sources of olfactory pollution beyond routine inspections conducted by local personnel.The successful deployment of the Instrumental Odour Monitoring System (IOMS) network, both at the production site and the neighborhood level, has yielded significant outcomes:•Enhanced understanding of olfactory nuisance sources: Employing various data processing techniques and odor sampling, over 12 repetitive sources such as blood, feathers, and biofilters were characterized and grouped.•Real-time odour levels assessment: Establishment of notification thresholds triggering alerts and alarms for prompt remediation actions, allowing for proactive measures to address operational issues.•Source identification: Utilizing the results of odour characterization and event logs, the 12 distinct odors were accurately mapped back to specific emitting sources.•Real-time odour characterization: Integration of olfactory nuisances into the IOMS programming, ensuring identification when odour unit thresholds are reached, facilitating swift implementation of remediation measures.•Correlation analysis: Collection of odour level data for correlation analysis with operational activities, providing valuable insights for refining processes and mitigating potential nuisances.Building upon previous successes, continuous monitoring has proven instrumental in surpassing customer expectations. This approach has effectively contributed to diminishing odour intensity, minimizing complaint occurrences, and distinguishing the facility from the diverse sources of emissions.","","979-8-3503-4865-1","10.1109/ISOEN61239.2024.10555987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555987","Dynamic Olfactometry;EN 13725:2022 - ASTM E679:2019;Industrial Sites;Continuous Monitoring;Remediation Actions;Olfactory Nuisance;Feed Production;Poultry Waste;Instrumental Odour Monitoring System (IOMS);Source Identification","Feathers;Analytical models;Instruments;Olfactory;Companies;Real-time systems;Pollution measurement","","","","3","IEEE","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This framework mainly contains two key parts: multibranch multilayer feature learning (M2FL) and a comprehensive classification criterion (CCC). In terms of the network structure, a multibranch multilayer structure is designed for customized and joint sensor feature extraction. To fuse the full features of different levels in the network, a joint training strategy is leveraged for multilayer classifiers. Regarding the classification strategy design, a CCC is proposed to fuse the prediction results of the base classifiers and the separation degree between a specific target sample and the source samples. In addition, to optimize the training process, we adopt an improved additional margin softmax classifier with nonlinear dynamic parameter adjustment.

Now we intended to step further about the alteration and estimation of this liquid film. Here, we developed a gas phase odor biosensor with variable liquid film thickness. The liquid layer thickness change was reflected as the impedance change between two electrodes. Thinner liquid film always resulted in greater response and faster peak time. For realizing such a thin liquid film state, withdrawing the buffer solution step by step was more preferred. Furthermore, the sample concentration dependency curves under normal and thin liquid layer conditions proved thin liquid film improved response evidently. Moreover, the weakened stability caused by thin liquid film was explained. Finally, we calculated the liquid film thickness according to the feedback control signal and validated the estimation result by manual operation. It revealed a steady liquid film thinner than 100  $\mu \text{m}$  was implemented in this system.

In particular, we study deterministic identification (DI) for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC), subject to an average and a peak molecule release rate constraint, which serves as a model for MC systems employing molecule counting receivers. It is established that the number of different messages that can be reliably identified for this channel scales as  $2^{(n\log n)R}$ , where  ${n}$  and  ${R}$  are the codeword length and coding rate, respectively. Lower and upper bounds on the DI capacity of the DTPC are developed. The obtained large capacity of the DI channel sheds light on the performance of natural DI systems such as natural olfaction, which are known for their extremely large chemical discriminatory power in biology. Furthermore, numerical results for the empirical miss-identification and false identification error rates are provided for finite length codes. This allows us to characterize the behaviour of the error rate for increasing codeword lengths, which complements our theoretically-derived scale for asymptotically large codeword lengths.","2332-7804","","10.1109/TMBMC.2023.3324487","German Research Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:DE 1915/2-1); 6G-Life Project(grant numbers:16KISK002); DFG(grant numbers:JA 3104/1-1); LOEWE Initiative (Hesse, Germany) within the emergenCITY Center; Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:939/23,2691/23); Israel VATAT Junior Faculty Program for Quantum Science and Technology(grant numbers:86636903); Chaya Career Advancement Chair(grant numbers:8776026); German–Israeli Project Cooperation (DIP)(grant numbers:2032991); Helen Diller Quantum Center at the Technion; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:16KIS1005,16KISQ028); 6G-Life Project(grant numbers:16KISK002); BMBF(grant numbers:16KIS1003K); National Initiative for “Molecular Communications” (MAMOKO)(grant numbers:16KIS0914); 6G-Life Project(grant numbers:16KISK002); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:16KIS1005,16KISQ028); 6G-Life Project(grant numbers:16KISK002); MAMOKO(grant numbers:16KIS0913); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285119","Channel capacity;deterministic identification;molecular communication;Poisson channel","Codes;Upper bound;Receivers;Olfactory;Channel coding;Nanobioscience;Molecular communication","","8","","93","IEEE","13 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different odorants stimulate different OR's due to the difference in shape, physical and chemical properties. In this paper, a deep neural network architecture DeepOlf, based on molecular features and fingerprints of odorants and ORs, to predict whether a chemical compound is a potential odorant or not along with its interacting OR is proposed. Odorant identification and Odorant-OR interaction were modeled as a binary classification through multiple classifiers. The evaluation of these classifier's performance showed that the deep-neural network framework not only fits data with better accuracy in comparison to other classical methods (SVM, RF, k-NN) but also able to predict odorant-OR interactions more accurately. To our knowledge, this study is the first realization of deep learning ideas for the problem of odorant and interacting OR prediction. The accuracy of DeepOlf was found to be 94.83 and 99.92 percent for the prediction of odorants and Odorant- OR interactions respectively.

This result is especially useful in the application of KIII and makes it possible to select parameter regions where KIII can operate as a robust dynamic system and associative memory device.","1098-7576","0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1381153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381153","","Neurodynamics;Chaos;Biological system modeling;Strontium;Chromium;Additive noise;Stochastic resonance;Biological neural networks;Limit-cycles;Biological information theory","","","","26","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Phenomena like food selection or motivation, based on chemical signals, present a unique pathway between chemosensory and emotion systems. Human chemosignals (i.e. sweat) which are produced during different emotional states contain associated distinctive odors and are able to induce same emotions in other people. For instance, sweat is known as a social chemosignal participating in social interaction. Chemosignal perception engages a distributed neural network which has not been well characterized yet. In this paper, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuits underlying social emotional chemosignal processing. Chemosignals associated with disgust and neutral conditions were used to induce specific emotional states in fMRI participants during a healthy food judgement. We performed fMRI analysis with the aim of detecting active areas in the brain, followed by a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis. fMRI analysis revealed functional activity in the fusiform face area (FFA), amygdala (AMG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In order to determine the effective connectivity among these regions as a result of emotional chemosignal processing, a set of dynamic causal models is proposed. Estimating parameters of the proposed models shows that social chemosignals modulate the connections between FFA, AMG and OFC. The results indicate that social chemosignals of disgust converge on orbitofrontal cortex - an area which is a critical region for object appraisal and valuation - after first influencing fusiform face area and amygdala.","2471-7819","978-1-7281-9574-2","10.1109/BIBE50027.2020.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288102","Human Chemosignal;Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM);Effective Connectivity;fMRI","Neural circuits;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Orbits;Integrated circuit modeling;Faces;Cost accounting","","","","17","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electronic Nose can be used to detect presence of such elements in excess in human body, through smelling of human breath, skin, or body fluid samples. The objective of this project is to implement a simple, low cost, and portable E-Nose that can be used to detect substances, such as, acetone, ammonia, alcohol, which contribute to Diabetes and Kidney Failure, among other elements, which could cause illness, or support further effect of the illness on human daily life. The main feature of the presented nose in this work, which uses Arduino hardware, is the intelligent Neural Networks software with Correlative Gaussian interpolation function. This function is used together with the Weight Elimination Algorithm (WEA) to enable smart classification of detected substances. The WEA works similar to genetic algorithm in the way it eliminates weak weights and links. Together with Correlative Gaussian, a Correlative Weight Elimination Algorithm is produces (CWEA). Such intelligent discrimination technique allowed not only to detect and classify chemicals in a single substance, but also, to detect and classify the same element and its overall effect in multiple substances. The obtained results are promising, with better results, and possibility of covering more substances, is applicable using higher level and integrated sensors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3343499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10360817","E-nose;signal processing;Arduino;neural networks;Gaussian interpolation;illness;discrimination;classification","Sensors;Chemical sensors;Chemicals;Gas detectors;Electronic noses;Sensor arrays;Pattern recognition","","","","61","CCBYNCND","15 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first is to show that the task of ‘recognition’ can be realized by an artificial neural net, and that the structures thus generated can be in close analogy to those observed in nature. The second is to note that absolute signal levels are almost meaningless in biological contexts; for these, the current state of a system is revealed by dynamic rather than static behaviour. This was Walter Freeman's observation, which led him to the oscillatory models which he has developed so notably; see the reference list. Coupling of the two sets of ideas leads to some striking conclusions, developed in Whittle (Neural Nets and Chaotic Carriers (1998) and Neural Nets and Chaotic Carriers, 2nd edn. (2010).

To do this, a novel double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method is elaborately proposed. First, two square-based feature sets, each with N levels, are constructed based on N power-spectral-density (PSD) features extracted from N EEG electrodes. Subsequently, the electrode sequence (ES) codes are obtained by arranging the N feature values of each level of each square feature set in ascending order. Finally, inspired by the k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN), a minimum inconsistency classification is presented to find the odor concentration class whose ES codes are the least inconsistent with those of the testing sample. In the experiment, rose and rotten odors, each with five concentrations, were used to induce olfactory EEG signals on 13 participants. Experimental results reveal that, using the proposed DSES method, considerably high classification accuracies of 94.2% and 92.9% on five different concentrations of the rose and rotten odors were obtained, respectively, significantly outperforming ten other methods. These results verify the superiority of the proposed DSES method in identifying different odor concentrations. In addition, the EEG dataset with 4550 samples is made public through the website presented in this study. In this way, the proposed DSES method combined with the published EEG dataset may further promote the development of olfactory EEG recognition research.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3090177","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0306200); Tianjin Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:20JCZDJC00150,20JCYBJC00320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458278","Biological signal processing;double-square-based electrode sequence (DSES) learning method;odor concentration stimulation;olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG);power-spectral-density (PSD) feature","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Olfactory;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Learning systems","","4","","38","IEEE","17 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dogs actively deform their nostrils when they sniff. The air in front of a dog is drawn to the nose by inhalation, and then, ejected backward. This backward jet further induces air currents flowing from the front of the dog to the nose, which assist in collecting odors. To mimic this mechanism, ASNose is equipped with two diaphragm pumps and two gas sensors. Air is sucked through two pipes, and delivered to the two gas sensors. The exhaust of the pumps is expired backward. Moreover, backflows inevitably generated by the diaphragm pumps make air currents flowing in the direction away from ASNose and work like an air curtain. Experimental results show that the actively generated air currents facilitate the directional determination of a gas source by enhancing the difference between the right and left gas sensor responses.","","978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725016","gas sensor;gas source localization;mobile robot;sniffing;air curtain","Olfactory;Gas detectors;Nose;DC generators;Robot sensing systems;Signal processing;Dogs;Orbital robotics;Fluid flow measurement;Animals","","9","","6","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among those techniques, EEG is the most widely used one due to its portability, low setup cost, and noninvasiveness. Apart from other advantages, EEG signals also help to evaluate the ability of the smelling organ. In such studies, EEG signals, which are recorded during smelling, are analyzed to determine the subject lacks any smelling ability or to measure the response of the brain. The main idea of this study is to show the emotional difference in EEG signals during perception of valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater odors by the EEG gamma wave. The proposed method was applied to the EEG signals, which were taken from five healthy subjects in the conditions of eyes open and eyes closed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In order to represent the signals, we extracted features from the gamma band of the EEG trials by continuous wavelet transform with the selection of Morlet as a wavelet function. Then the -nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented as the classifier for recognizing the EEG trials as valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater. We achieved an average classification accuracy rate of 87.50% with the 4.3 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-open condition and an average classification accuracy rate of 94.12% with the 2.9 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-closed condition. The results prove that the proposed continuous wavelet transform–based feature extraction method has great potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during smelling of the present odors. It has been also established that gamma-band activity of the brain is highly associated with olfaction.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932904","","","","14","","","Traditional","23 May 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

When the air currents are not provided, the user feels as if the source is placed nearby. We hypothesize that this sensation is caused by the upward air currents generated by our body temperature. When there is no wind, only the odors from nearby sources are brought to our noses by the upward air currents. The result of a sensory test shows that the perceived location of an odor source changes with the airflow presented to the panelist. Providing airflow together with odors is thus promising to reproduce complicated situations that cannot be reproduced by olfactory stimulation alone.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-6238-4","10.1109/VR.2010.5444763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444763","Olfactory display;computational fluid dynamics;sensory test","Olfactory;Displays;Temperature sensors;Nose;Testing;Computational fluid dynamics;Virtual reality;Fans;Agriculture;Multimedia systems","","2","","4","IEEE","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 millions. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Non-motor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that this models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson's disease.","","978-1-5090-4620-1","10.1109/SCOPES.2016.7955679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7955679","Improved Accuracy;Prediction of Parkinson's Disease;Non Motor Features;Biomarkers;Machine Learning Techniques;Boosted Logistic Regression;BayesNet;Multilayer Per-ceptron","Parkinson's disease;Biomarkers;Biological system modeling;Olfactory;Single photon emission computed tomography","","69","","28","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With virtual reality (VR), so-called human influential factors play a crucial role in the final perceived immersive media experience (IMEx). While two individuals can use the same VR headset, play the same game in the same location, and have the same goals, the two individuals can have very different experiences, with varying perceptions of immersion, presence, realism, engagement, and cybersickness. This can be particularly true in multisensory immersive experiences where, in addition to audio-visual stimuli, olfactory and haptic feedback can be used. In this paper, we describe a pilot study in which a VR game was developed to combine audio-visual, olfactory, and haptic feedback to the user in real-time. After game play, participants were asked about their IMEx using five scales: realism, immersion, presence, engagement, and overall quality of experience (QoE). Moreover, using an instrumented VR headset we measure electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electrooculography (EOG) signals and compute several instrumental measures of human influential factors, including an engagement index, arousal and valence indices, frontal alpha asymmetry, heart rate, several EEG sub-band powers, and eye blink rate. Using the subjective ratings, we measure the contribution that each IMEx subscale has on overall QoE, as a function of the type of sensory stimuli used. Results on 11 participants suggest very different contributions once smells and haptics are incorporated, relative to traditional audio-visual experiences. We also report on several instrumental measures that showed significant correlations with the IMEx subscales, suggesting that, in the future, real-time instrumental QoE measurement of multisensory experiences could be possible.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-8794-8","10.1109/QoMEX55416.2022.9900907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900907","Multisensory experience;olfaction;haptics;virtual reality;immersive media experience (IMEx)","Headphones;Atmospheric measurements;Instruments;Olfactory;Games;Particle measurements;Real-time systems","","5","","45","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of serious games in virtual reality (VR) has shown promising results in therapy for adults with Amblyopia, which was often considered significantly harder to treat. This paper reports using a VR game developed in collaboration with an Ophthalmologist to improve visual acuity in adults with Amblyopia.

The progression rate and manifestation of PD is highly heterogenous, and the underlying etiology for this heterogeneity remains elusive. Although some studies have identified risk genes associated with the development of PD, it is unknown whether the patient genome influences the progression pattern of PD in any way. In this study, we used the whole-exome sequencing data of PD patients from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine whether an individual's genetic profile is associated with their progression pattern of PD. We used the three distinct progression subtypes defined by Zhang et al. as the outcome variable, and trained logistic regression and support vector classifiers. Our best performing model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 on the test set, indicating that the genetic profile of a PD patient appears to have some relationship with their likely disease course. We then interpreted our trained model by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on the sets of genes with high model coefficients for each progression subtype. The results showed enrichment for genes related to olfactory signaling in Subtype I and III, and an enrichment for genes related to protein glycosylation and glycation for Subtype I and II. Overall, our findings suggests a connection between an individual's genetic profile and PD progression subtype, and calls for controlled research studies to further examine the relationship between the implicated gene sets and each progression subtype.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313376","Parkinson’s Disease;progression subtype;machine learning;germline variants;genetic profile","Diseases;Olfactory;Bioinformatics;Support vector machines;Genomics;Predictive models;Sequential analysis","","1","","17","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Devices that model the jet discharge of crayfish have been developed to investigate the effectiveness of the active chemical sampling. Experimental results are presented to confirm that water samples are drawn to the chemical sensors from the surroundings more rapidly by using the axisymmetric flow field generated by the jet discharge than by centrosymmetric flow field generated by simple water suction.

Two formalisms are analyzed: regular SVMs and the so-called inhibitory SVMs. The regularization term in regular SVMs brings the synaptic vectors of the two neurons close to each other, while the inhibitory SVM can bring them to 0 resembling the memory loss process in Hebbian learning.

There is experimental evidence of multiplexing of sensory information across population of neurons, particularly in the vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Recently, it has been discovered that in lateral intraparietal cortex of the brain, decision signals are multiplexed with decision-irrelevant visual signals. Furthermore, it is well known that several cortical neurons exhibit chaotic spiking patterns. Multiplexing of chaotic neural signals and their successful demultiplexing in the neurons amidst interference and noise, is difficult to explain. In this work, a novel compressed sensing model for efficient multiplexing of chaotic neural signals constructed using the Hindmarsh-Rose spiking model is proposed. The signals are multiplexed from a pre-synaptic neuron to its neighbouring post-synaptic neuron, in the presence of 104 interfering noisy neural signals and demultiplexed using compressed sensing techniques.","","978-1-5090-1746-1","10.1109/SPCOM.2016.7746641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746641","","Neurons;Multiplexing;Mathematical model;Noise measurement;Compressed sensing;Brain modeling;Chaos","","2","","24","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a database of olfactory responses, we selected target ORs from two insect species, i.e., Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, for introduction into Sf21 cells along with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein gene GCaMP6s. Based on calcium imaging, Sf21 cells expressing DmelOR13a responded to the human-derived odorant 1-octen-3-ol and Sf21 cells expressing AgamOR16 responded to the human aging-related odorant Z2-nonenal.

Current techniques such as epifluorescence microscopy have reasonable time resolution but suffer from signal-to-background problems when viewing thick samples, while confocal techniques are limited in time resolution and/or photon efficiency. To address some of these limitations, we have developed a novel form of microscopy for high-speed three-dimensional fluorescence imaging.

In particular, links between experts and routine users of intelligent virtual reality systems (IVRS) can be established by analyzing the reactions and opinions of the experts. The analysis should produce a mathematical realization of the expert's knowledge or judgment which can easily be incorporated into IVRS. Mechanisms suggested for approaching this problem are threefold: neural network clustering, fuzzy risk analysis for evaluation, and invoking programs which ""memorize"" an expert's analytic habits. For control applications, cloning an expert can initialize a process, tracking adherence to non stationary set points can monitor system state variable shifts, and fuzzy risk analysis can encourage tuning the system to approach sensible performance measures. Examples of analysis of olfactory neurons in the rat and health monitoring of a missile guidance system are presented to illustrate these suggestions. The use of subjectivity can be a strong modeling tool when it is properly labeled and invoked. To further the appropriate use of subjectivity in analysis, expert decisions and analytic techniques are being monitored by a ""memorizing"" program for future analysis and extensions into virtuality.","","0-86422-430-3","10.1109/ANZIIS.1995.705730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=705730","","Filters;Risk analysis;Monitoring;Computational intelligence;Intelligent systems;Competitive intelligence;Virtual reality;Neural networks;Fuzzy neural networks;Control systems","","","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we present the results of a study in which participants were confronted with congruent and incongruent visual and olfactory stimuli while eating a tasteless food product in VR. We were interested (1) if participants integrate bi-modal congruent stimuli and (2) if vision guides MSI during congruent/incongruent conditions. Our results contain three main findings: First, and surprisingly, participants were not always able to detect congruent visual-olfactory stimuli when eating a portion of tasteless food. Second, when confronted with tri-modal incongruent cues, a majority of participants did not rely on any of the presented cues when forced to identify what they eat; this includes vision which has previously been shown to dominate MSI. Third, although research has shown that basic taste qualities like sweetness, saltiness, or sourness can be influenced by congruent cues, doing so with more complex flavors (e.g., zucchini or carrot) proved to be harder to achieve. We discuss our results in the context of multimodal integration, and within the domain of multisensory AR/VR.

However, this has not been a trivial task to achieve with existing conventional gas separation and sensing devices. In this study, a novel compact room temperature-operated sensing system is proposed to separate and quantify each component in a vapor mixture with simple operation. The sensing system consists of a portable and replaceable gas separation column and a sensing module containing a nanomechanical Membrane-type Surface stress Sensor, MSS. Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) results show that the gas separation column can clearly separate methanol and ethanol in their mixtures. The sensing signals from the column-MSS system are consistent with the peaks measured by PTR-TOF-MS. For mixtures of methanol and ethanol with various ratios, a clear correspondence is observed between the output signals and the theoretically calculated vapor pressure ratios of each mixture. The developed compact room temperature-operated sensing system can discriminate and quantify different methanol and ethanol mixtures, paving the way for practical applications of olfactory sensing devices.","2168-9229","979-8-3503-6351-7","10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10784477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10784477","olfactory sensors;room temperature-operated;real-time;gas mixture;separation;quantification;MSS","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Protons;Ethanol;Surface stress;Olfactory;Quality control;Sensors;Pressure measurement;Methanol","","","","13","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though, it is very difficult to predict the smell perception of a molecule from its molecular properties. It is reported that structurally very similar types of molecules can produce a different smell, and structurally very different types of molecules can produce the nearly same smell. The goal of the manuscript is to have a comparative performance measure between the existing machine learning algorithms like ANN, SVR, DTR, RFR, and CNN, while using the DREAM olfaction challenge dataset and a series of defined feature set. In this paper, we have used machine learning approach to predict the Molecular olfactory perception based on the molecular descriptors of structurally different molecules. 4884 molecular descriptors of 472 structurally different molecules were used in this study. In terms of machine learning, it's a multi-input and multi-output regression problem and every feature need to be combined to give output in 21 targets. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Support Vector Machine (SVR), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) has been used to predict the olfactory perception of a molecule. For the validation of our model R-Squared method with residual plots has been used. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) has been used for Error calculation. The ANN regression model performed better than all the other models used in this study. For the ANN regression model, MSE and MAE were 44.56 and 4.19 respectively.","","978-1-7281-8829-4","10.1109/EnT50437.2020.9431257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9431257","Machine learning;Regression;Olfactory perception;Molecular descriptors","Support vector machines;Industries;Machine learning algorithms;Olfactory;Artificial neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Data models","","","","16","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is precisely what we target in this paper, which reports the results of an empirical investigation examining how scent intensity and valence impact mulsemedia Quality of Experience (QoE). Accordingly, 54 participants were exposed to different odor valences and scent intensity levels when viewing three short multimedia clips. In particular, we examine both subjective (self-reported) as well as objective QoE metrics, as evidenced by user heart rates and eye gaze patterns. Results show that whilst eye gaze patterns are largely unaffected by the experimental conditions, valence does have a statistically significant impact upon user heart rates, as does intensity for two of the three clips employed in our study. In terms of subjective QoE, results indicate that hedonic valence impacts on the sense of reality and enjoyment; however varying odor intensity levels do not seem to differentially impact on user experience, bringing into question the need for strong scent intensities.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.2992948","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program(grant numbers:688503); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior(grant numbers:88881.187844/2018-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088247","QoE;olfaction;hedonic valence;intensity;odor hedonic quality;mulsemedia;eye tracking;heart rate","Quality of experience;Olfactory;Heart rate;Media;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Electroencephalography","","18","","56","IEEE","6 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we employed the functional connectome approach to study the brain functional networks derived from fMRI data. Several graph theoretical measurements were employed to quantitatively investigate differences in global and local information transfer efficiency calculated between rest and task experimental conditions. Our results have suggested that normalized clustering coefficient was larger during rest compared to task, indicating more local efficiency of information transfer during rest, while small-worldness was preserved. In addition, the betweenness centrality of nodes was larger for task than rest at the orbital part of right superior frontal gyrus, the orbital part of right middle frontal gyrus and right olfactory cortex. In contrast, this parameter was larger for rest at left fusiform gyrus.

The current study presents an innovative approach based on data mining, whose goal is to extract knowledge from a dataset. This approach uses a subgroup discovery algorithm which allows extraction of rules that apply to as many olfactory stimuli and individuals as possible. These rules are described by intervals on a set of physiological attributes. Results allowed both quantifying how each physiological parameter relates to odor pleasantness and perceived intensity but also describing the participation of each individual to these rules.

Here we study how such plasticity can be used to form memories and input representations when the neural dynamics are oscillatory, as is common in the brain (particularly in the hippocampus and olfactory cortex). Learning is assumed to occur in a phase of neural plasticity, in which the network is clamped to external teaching signals. By suitable manipulation of the nonlinearity of the neurons or the oscillation frequencies during learning, the model can be made, in a retrieval phase, either to categorize new inputs or to map them, in a continuous fashion, onto the space spanned by the imprinted patterns. We identify the first of these possibilities with the function of olfactory cortex and the second with the observed response characteristics of place cells in hippocampus. We investigate both kinds of networks analytically and by computer simulations, and we link the models with experimental findings, exploring, in particular, how the spike timing dependence of the synaptic plasticity constrains the computational function of the network and vice versa.","0899-7667","","10.1162/08997660260293265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789186","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Molecular diffusion is an extremely slow process and odor molecules released from their source are spread by being carried off by airflow. Therefore, we propose to use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in conjunction with the olfactory display. The CFD solver is employed to calculate the turbulent airflow field in the given environment and the dispersal of odor molecules from their source. The simulation result is used to reproduce at the nose the realistic change in the odor concentration with time and space. However, our initial sensory test for evaluating the proposed method was not completely successful, and we also found some discrepancies between our real-life olfactory sensation and the experience of the CFD-based olfactory display. Here we report some insights to overcome these problems. In the initial sensory test, a nontrivial portion of the subjects did not properly recognize the spatial variation in the odor intensity. The result of our recent sensory test is presented in this paper to show that better contrast in the perceived odor intensity can be provided when the concentration range of the released odor is adjusted for the variation in the olfactory sensitivity of individual subjects. We noted that olfactory adaptation occurred more quickly in the initial sensory test of the CFD-based olfactory display than in real environments. In this paper, we show that olfactory adaptation can be alleviated by modulating the odor concentration randomly to mimic the random fluctuations of the turbulent flow fields in real environments. We also noted in our initial sensory test that there were sometimes discrepancies between our olfactory sensation in real environments and the simulated odor distribution. We show in this paper that the discrepancy can be attributed to the convection caused by the human body temperature that brings an odor vapor that is drifting around our feet up to our noses.","1054-7460","","10.1162/pres_a_00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797285","","","","4","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

There are several studies confirmed that VI learners acknowledge the potentials and advantages of e-learning or virtual learning systems. However, not like sighted learning, VI learners face several challenges in using e-learning materials which are available on the shelf. Most of the virtual learning environments are designed for sighted learning and rich utilization of images and interactivities result the restrictions for the VI to use learning platforms in a virtual environment. Most of the VI learners are relying on screen reader to translate the contents from screen or documents. Thus, careful consideration is important in designing the learning environment for VI according to their requirements and accessibility to provide engaging virtual learning environment for them. Hence, this paper proposes a 3D enabled olfactory, haptic and audio (3DOHA) enhanced application for visually impaired learners to use in a virtual learning environment and evaluates the proposed application by conducting a pilot testing.

Fragrance diffusers have been used as the potential appliance to reconcile mental conditions and achieve stress relief in daily life. Although perceiving fragrances are a complicated and subjective experience, studies have shown that it is possible to reveal the personal preference of fragrance from brain activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, using EEG to detect neural/mental states and apply them to human-machine interfaces has also been investigated for years. Therefore, this pilot study has two aims: (1) to identify users’ preference for fragrances from EEG; (2) to develop a personalized fragrance diffuser, Aroma Box, which can detect three mental states from EEG when a user feels depressed, stressed, or drowsily and then release fragrances in real-time to help user recover from the abnormal states. To achieve this goal, we first extracted the features and built a classifier to identify the user’s preference for fragrances from EEG. Then we calculated the indicators of brain states based on the EEG frequency analysis. Based on our preliminary experimental results, we deployed our algorithms in an in-house developed diffuser with a consumer 32-channel EEG headset, which has been further implemented in a real-life working environment and evaluated its efficacy by two users.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582446","National Cheng Kung University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582446","Olfactory perception;EEG;fragrance diffuser;brain-computer interface;human-computer interaction","Headphones;Electric potential;Conferences;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Regulation","","1","","26","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These biosensors, however, suffer nonlinearity, drift, and aging problems. We previously developed an active sensing method to solve those problems but it took relatively long time to obtain a final result. Here, we have developed a gas-phase odorant fast quantification method to speed up the quantification procedure. The odor intensity was controlled by the stimulation duration and the experiment target was to quantify an unknown intensity. We first focused on the odorant geosmin, and obtained a standard response model by curve fitting with the response data from several odor intensities. This model was used to calculate an unknown odor intensity thus solving the nonlinear issue. During the experiment, known and unknown odor stimulations were alternately supplied. The biosensor response was calibrated based on the known odor stimulation response, thereby overcoming the drift and aging problems. Fast quantification was successfully achieved in 400 s which was much faster than previous research. Furthermore, we studied the effect of stimulation interval on quantification accuracy. Moreover, we presented a skip-enable fast quantification approach which increased the sampling rate especially when the odor stimulation was sparse. In addition, the feasibility of fast quantification method was verified again on odorant 1-octen-3-ol. The fast quantification method demonstrated in this study will benefit the practical application of gas-phase odor biosensors, particularly for variable target odorants.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3309968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10241293","Fast quantification;gas-phase odorant;odor biosensor;olfactory receptor (OR);reference response model","Sensors;Biosensors;Biological system modeling;Liquids;Brightness;Aging;Fluorescence","","3","","29","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the results of two subjective studies which analyzed user QoE of olfaction-enhanced multimedia. Diverse scent types and video content were considered. In particular, QoE levels were studied when one and two olfaction stimuli enhanced audiovisual media. The results presented show that scent type influences user QoE. Statistically significant differences between pleasant and unpleasant scent types existed. Also, in certain cases, users were prepared to forgive the presence of unpleasant scent types with respect to QoE.

The designed circuit mainly consists of three modules: 1) the threshold module, which uses to determine the threshold level of conditioned stimuli (CS) that the brain can use to trigger learning and memory effects; 2) the synergy module, which performs cross-modal synergy processing of CS signals; and 3) the synapse and neuron module, which uses memristors to mimic synaptic weights and output neurons for associative learning. According to the different intensities of the input stimuli signals under conditioning, the proposed circuit implements the innovative functions, such as unimodal learning with threshold, cross-modal reinforcement, cross-modal facilitation, and cross-modal memory transfer.

In this research, we constructed and evaluated a wearable olfactory display to present the spatiality of odor in an outdoor environment. The prototype wearable olfactory display system treats odor in the gaseous state, and the odor air is conveyed to the user’s nose through tubes. Using this system, we also present the spatiality of odor by controlling the odor strength according to the positions of the user and the odor source. With this prototype system, the user can specify the position of the odor source in an outdoor environment. To improve this prototype system, we constructed another wearable olfactory display. Because odor is treated in the gaseous state, the first prototype system has some problems such as the large size of the device and unintentional leakage of the odor into the environment. To solve these issues, we developed and evaluated an advanced wearable olfactory display that uses an inkjet head device to treat odor in the liquid state.","2375-5334","1-4244-0224-7","10.1109/VR.2006.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667645","","Olfactory;Displays;Prototypes;Virtual reality;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Chemical sensors;Nose;Control systems;Wearable sensors;Haptic interfaces","","100","3","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, developing such deep learning method, which can successfully extract meaningful features from various breast cancer sub-types, is of current research interest. In this paper, we develop dual stage (unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning) neural network architecture termed AFExNet based on adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) to extract features from high dimensional genetic data. We evaluated the performance of our model through twelve different supervised classifiers to verify the usefulness of the new features using public RNA-Seq dataset of breast cancer. AFExNet provides consistent results in all performance metrics across twelve different classifiers which makes our model classifier independent. We also develop a method named ‘TopGene’ to find highly weighted genes from the latent space which could be useful for finding cancer bio-markers.

Dynamical system formulations of weakly coupled oscillator systems have proven effective at capturing the properties of real-world systems and are compelling models of neural systems. However, these formulations usually deal with the forward problem: simulating a system from known coupling parameters. Here we provide a solution to the inverse problem: determining the coupling parameters from measurements. Starting from the dynamic equations of a system of symmetrically coupled phase oscillators, given by a nonlinear Langevin equation, we derive the corresponding equilibrium distribution. This formulation leads us to the maximum entropy distribution that captures pairwise phase relationships. To solve the inverse problem for this distribution, we derive a closed-form solution for estimating the phase coupling parameters from observed phase statistics. Through simulations, we show that the algorithm performs well in high dimensions (d = 100) and in cases with limited data (as few as 100 samples per dimension). In addition, we derive a regularized solution to the estimation and show that the resulting procedure improves performance when only a limited amount of data is available. Because the distribution serves as the unique maximum entropy solution for pairwise phase statistics, phase coupling estimation can be broadly applied in any situation where phase measurements are made. Under the physical interpretation, the model may be used for inferring coupling relationships within cortical networks.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796819","","","","3","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from healthy subjects performing a passive odor task of odorants with different valence. Once defined a fully-connected a priori network comprising the pyriform cortex (PC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and entorhinal cortex (EC), we tested the modulatory effect of odor valence on their causal interactions at the group level using the parametric empirical bayes (PEB) framework. Results show that both pleasant and the unpleasant odors have an inhibitory effect on the connection from EC to PC, whereas we did not observe any effect for the neutral odor. Moreover, the odor with positive valence has a stronger influence on connectivity dynamics compared to the negative odor.

An important use case of such adaptation is industrial odor-sensing. Metal-oxide-based sensors can be used to detect gaseous compounds in the air; however, the gases interact with the sensors, causing their responses to change over time in a process called sensor drift. Sensor drift is irreversible and requires frequent recalibration with additional data. This paper demonstrates that an adaptive system that represents the drift as context for the skill of odor sensing achieves the same goal automatically. After it is trained on the history of changes, a neural network predicts future contexts, allowing the context+skill sensing system to adapt to sensor drift. Evaluated on an industrial dataset of gas-sensor drift, the approach performed better than standard drift-naive and ensembling methods. In this way, the context+skill system emulates the natural ability of animal olfaction systems to adapt to a changing world, and demonstrates how it can be effective in real-world applications.","","979-8-3503-4855-2","10.1109/ICDL61372.2024.10644949","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:HR0011-18-2-0024); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01DC020653); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10644949","classification;olfaction;drift;adaptation;LSTM","Recurrent neural networks;Animals;Learning (artificial intelligence);Sensor systems;Sensors;Recording;Reliability","","","","28","IEEE","27 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors (1991) previously reported large parallel changes in the accommodation of CA1 neurons to current injection and the distribution of protein kinase C which occur around the time that the neonate opens its eyes. In the present work, it is argued that (1) such changes reflect the developmentally programmed engagement of the hippocampal mapping system, (2) visual information has a special privileged access to such a system, and (3) the engagement of this system is one of the definitive events of early mammalian development in that it allows the newborn to create cognitive maps of its immediate environs.<>","","0-7803-0559-0","10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=227144","","Hippocampus;Pediatrics;Animals;Rabbits;Eyes;Switches;Proteins;Neurons;Diseases;Petroleum","","","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By utilizing the deflected airflow, the MSF display can present the airflow blowing from the front to the user without placing fans in front of the user. The directivity of the airflow deflection can be controlled by placing nozzles on the fans to adjust the cross-sectional shape of the airflow jets coming from the fans.

A scent projector is a system that delivers a small amount of scented air to the user's nose by channeling the scent through a vortex ring. A projector enables scents to be presented locally in time and space without requiring the user to wear any special apparatus. Such localization is important when scents are presented synchronously with other sensory stimuli. However, scent projectors make use of so-called “air cannons” that usually have significant volume, making their size a major drawback. To solve this problem, we examined the principal parameters that affect the performance of a scent projector, and found that the inner volume of the air cannon does not seriously affect the range of a vortex ring. Based on this analysis, we designed a flat-shaped scent projector that has zero volume in the idle state and built a prototype system. Our prototype performed almost as well as existing scent projectors with larger volume.","2375-5334","978-1-4673-1246-2","10.1109/VR.2012.6180930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180930","Olfactory display;scent projector;vortex ring","Face;Prototypes;Olfactory;Apertures;Virtual reality;Drives","","2","","5","IEEE","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Olfaction plays a significant role in natural life of most animals. For some animals, olfactory cues are far more effective than visual or auditory cues in search for objects such as foods and nests. Although chemical sensing is far simpler than vision or hearing, navigation in a chemical diffusion field is still not well understood. Therefore, this powerful primary sense has rarely been used inside the robotics community. This paper presents an effective olfactory-based planning and search algorithms for using on mobile robots. Olfactory-based mobile robots use odors as a guide to navigate and track in the unknown environments. The planning algorithms are based on Bayesian inference theory and artificial potential field methods. Inputs to the algorithms include the measured flow and the detection or non-detection events that happened at the robot location. This methodology results in algorithms for predicting likelihood of source location versus position. The robot would then optimize a desired trajectory to navigate in the odor plume and locate the odor source location.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5353993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353993","","Mobile robots;Inference algorithms;Animals;Navigation;Chemicals;Position measurement;Olfactory;Auditory system;Robot sensing systems;Bayesian methods","","10","","32","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its key features include: 1) a bio-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), approximation to the mammalian olfactory system that enables rapid retraining over nine types of gas with no accuracy loss to overcome the disturbance caused by sensor drift; 2) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with lateral inhibition supporting few shot that achieves over 95% accuracy with less than five training samples per gas; and 3) asynchronous SNN circuits with a self-skipping epoch learning (SSEL) mechanism to skip unnecessary weight update reducing over 84% training costs. These features allow the processor to recognize more than nine kinds of gases with 97.85% accuracy, and estimate gas concentration with a 1.83% error rate. The chip is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process with a peak efficiency of 1.04 pJ per synaptic operation (SOP) at 0.55 V.

Other common odour detection instruments like electronic noses (E-noses), mass spectrometers (MS), differential optical absorption spectrometers (DOAS) are also reviewed in this paper. The selection of any odour detection technique is influenced by several factors like on-field deployability, odour detection and classification capabilities, sensitivity of the instruments and sensitivity of the instruments to the air matrices. Among all the possible detection methods, Electronic nose is having advanced capabilities as compared to other instruments.

The electronic nose (e-nose) is a sensor-based instrument concerning tea quality assessment inspired by the human olfactory system. It, combined with statistical analytics, can enhance the performance of quality testing accuracy. Sensors are selected based on dominant compounds like hydrocarbons, alcohol, ketones, and aldehydes. Using targeted sensors and an appropriate statistical analysis should simplify prediction computation. Notably, green tea's pleasant aroma may not be very intense, necessitating a comprehensive sensor array. Integrating tasting assessments can enhance the accuracy of electronic nose predictions.","2769-5492","979-8-3503-7857-3","10.1109/ISITIA63062.2024.10667683","Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember; Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10667683","aroma;e-nose;green tea;sensors;VOCs","Volatile organic compounds;Accuracy;Statistical analysis;Hydrocarbons;Electronic noses;Sensors;Compounds","","","","16","IEEE","12 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this letter, we first compared the olfactory characteristics of an insect (silkworm moth, Bombyx mori), which has high CPT performance and the characteristics of an artificial odor sensor. In particular, we focused on and compared the recovery times of the two types of sensors, which plays an important role in the acquisition of odor information. As a result, it was determined that the recovery time for the insect olfactory sensor was ten times faster than that of the artificial odor sensor. We also experimentally evaluated the effect of this difference in the recovery time on CPT performance. CPT experiments using silkworm moths and a robot revealed that there was a correlation between the CPT performance and sensor recovery time. As such, it was demonstrated that it is necessary to improve not only the algorithm but also the sensor recovery time to improve the CPT performance.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2921948","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19K14943,JP19H04930,JP19H02104); Human Frontier Science Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733896","Chemical plume tracing;bio-inspired robotics;flight muscle electromyograms;behavior estimation","Robot sensing systems;Olfactory;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Insects;Chemicals;Bio-inspired engineering","","10","","31","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide a stimulus reconstruction scheme based on the spike times of the ensemble of neurons and derive conditions for perfect recovery. The key result calls for the spike density of the neural population to be above the Nyquist rate. We also show that recovery is perfect if the number of neurons in the population is larger than a threshold value. Increasing the number of neurons to achieve a faithful representation of the sensory world is consistent with basic neurobiological thought.

These classifiers rely on one-to-one mapping between the target gas and the temporal sequence of spiking sensors in an electronic nose. However, shuffled spike sequences, due to low repeatability of the response patterns from the sensors, limit the performance of these classifiers. We propose a robust probabilistic rank score coding scheme that tabulates the probability of each spiking sensor at each rank, or temporal position, by exploiting all the spike sequences of the sensors for each target gas, and we analyze a new test vector with this tabular information for its identification. A new quantification metric is proposed in order to estimate the confidence of the classifier’s output. Overall, our coding scheme provides an analytical solution that spots the most probable gas for any new test spike sequence with the quantitative feedback. In order to evaluate the robustness of our coding scheme, we target the identification of commonly found health-endangering indoor gases, such as C6H6, CH2O, CO, NO2, and SO2, as a case study.

These algorithms allow programming of the network vector field regardless of the patterns to be stored. Stability of patterns and cycles, basin geometry, and rates of convergence may be controlled. For a network of n nodes, n static of n/2 periodic attractors can be stored by a projection algorithm. For orthogonal patterns, this learning operation reduces to a kind of periodic outer product rule that allows local, additive, and commutative incremental learning. Standing- or traveling-wave cycles may be stored to mimic the kind of oscillating spatial patterns that appear in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb and prepyriform cortex during inspiration, and suffice, in the bulb, to predict the pattern recognition behavior of rabbits in classical conditioning experiments.

In particular, after learning a set of stimuli modeled after distinct groups of odors, the simulated network's initial response to a cue indicates only its group or category, whereas subsequent responses to the same stimulus successively subdivide the group into increasingly specific encoding of the individual cue. These sequences of responses amount to an automated organization of perceptual memories according to both their similarities and differences, facilitating transfer of learned information to novel stimuli without loss of specific information about exceptions. Human recognition performance robustly exhibits such multiple levels: a given object can be identified as a vehicle, as an automobile, or as a Mustang. The findings reported here suggest that a function as apparently complex as hierarchical recognition memory, which seems suggestive of higher ‘cognitive’ processes, may be a fundamental intrinsic property of the operation of this single cortical cell layer in response to naturally-occurring inputs to the structure. We offer the hypothesis that the network function of superficial cerebral conical layers may simultaneously acquire and hierarchically organize information about the similarities and differences among perceived stimuli.

Artificial olfactory systems utilize arrays of chemiresistive sensors to maximize discriminability of chemical analytes given sensor responses. At deployment time, exposures to analytes may differ from training in concentrations, analyte types, and environmental factors. Training machine learning models to remain accurate on distribution-shifted testing data requires performing many diverse, costly experiments in controlled laboratory settings to create a well-rounded training data set. In practice even expensive, large data sets may be insufficient for generalization of a trained model to a real-world testing distribution. It is possible but costly to create large, diverse datasets of single-analyte exposures, but experimentation with multi-analyte combinations quickly becomes intractable. With this in mind, we benchmark and propose machine learning and deep learning approaches to the detection of obscured chemical analytes given only single-analyte training. We significantly improve upon baseline classification of a particular chemical analyte borne in vapor mixed with an obscurant chemical agent by inducing multitask learning through adversarial data synthesizing models. Given chemical analyte exposure times between 0.75 and 5 seconds and across three unique experiment data sets comprised of different sensors and experimental controls, we find approaches utilizing Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGANs) outperform machine learning and comparable neural network approaches. We corroborate with multitask learning to find that across domains the utilization of generative tasks in supervised learners may increase data efficiency and model robustness to out-of-distribution samples without additional data annotation.","","978-1-6654-6283-9","10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10069244","Chemical sensors;deep learning;multitask learning","Training;Chemical sensors;Training data;Data models;Sensor systems;Chemical and biological sensors;Safety","","3","","27","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Chaos theory is essentially a recent extension of a larger field of mathematics which it is part of: nonlinear system dynamics (NSD). It mainly addresses systems governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) or their discrete-time cousins. Because the vast bulk of models now used in computational neuroscience are ODE models, it is only natural that neuroscience has developed great interest in the use of NSD as a tool for analyzing and designing neural network models. Walter Freeman, in particular, has played a seminal role in describing how chaos theory can be used in computational neuroscience, in his classical models of the olfactory system, described in articles in Scientific American and many scientific journals and IJCNN proceedings. His colleague Morris Hirsch in mathematics has helped provide a solid foundation for this work. This work has helped to inspire many efforts throughout the world to use chaos as a design principle in computer systems and in artificial neural network (ANN) design. Recently, however, several issues or questions have begun to emerge, some at Berkeley and some in other places. The author discusses these questions and their implications.","1098-7576","0-7695-0619-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2000.860744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=860744","","Chaos;Complexity theory;Neuroscience;Solids;Mathematics;Computer networks;Artificial neural networks;Nonlinear systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Differential equations","","2","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing demand for gas analysis in industries, the environment, and medical fields, the electronic nose has garnered widespread attention as a fast, convenient, and efficient gas identification tool. However, accurate gas-type discrimination and concentration prediction have remained challenging in electronic nose research due to the complexity and diversity of gas samples. Therefore, we proposed an innovative multitask learning approach, gated recurrent unit (GRU)-convolutional neural network (CNN)-MTL, combining a GRU and a 1-D CNN for gas-type discrimination and concentration prediction tasks. Attention mechanisms were separately integrated into GRU and 1-D CNN, allowing the model to automatically learn and focus on critical features relevant to the studies, thereby enhancing discrimination and prediction accuracy. Additionally, Bayesian optimization algorithms were employed to discover the optimal hyperparameter combinations, further optimizing the model’s performance. Experiments were conducted on two publicly available datasets, demonstrating outstanding performance with 99.84% accuracy and 97.57%  ${R}^{{2}}$  achieved on the first dataset and 99.92% accuracy and 99.97%  ${R}^{{2}}$  performed on the second dataset.

Recently, methods inspired by the brain, such as continual representation learning and memory replay, have been used to combat catastrophic forgetting. Associative learning (retaining associations between inputs and outputs, even after good representations are learned) plays an important function in the brain; however, its role in continual learning has not been carefully studied. Here, we identified a two-layer neural circuit in the fruit fly olfactory system that performs continual associative learning between odors and their associated valences. In the first layer, inputs (odors) are encoded using sparse, high-dimensional representations, which reduces memory interference by activating nonoverlapping populations of neurons for different odors. In the second layer, only the synapses between odor-activated neurons and the odor’s associated output neuron are modified during learning; the rest of the weights are frozen to prevent unrelated memories from being overwritten. We prove theoretically that these two perceptron-like layers help reduce catastrophic forgetting compared to the original perceptron algorithm, under continual learning. We then show empirically on benchmark data sets that this simple and lightweight architecture outperforms other popular neural-inspired algorithms when also using a two-layer feedforward architecture. Overall, fruit flies evolved an efficient continual associative learning algorithm, and circuit mechanisms from neuroscience can be translated to improve machine computation.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco_a_01615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10304669","","","","1","","","","1 Nov 2023","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

It is therefore important to find an estimator that gives reliable results from experimental data, that is, the estimator should be unbiased and have low estimation variance. When the CV is evaluated in the standard way (empirical standard deviation of interspike intervals divided by their average), then the estimator is biased, underestimating the true CV, especially if the distribution of the interspike intervals is positively skewed. Moreover, the estimator has a large variance for commonly used distributions. The aim of this letter is to quantify the bias and propose alternative estimation methods. If the distribution is assumed known or can be determined from data, parametric estimators are proposed, which not only remove the bias but also decrease the estimation errors. If no distribution is assumed and the data are very positively skewed, we propose to correct the standard estimator. When defining the corrected estimator, we simply use that it is more stable to work on the log scale for positively skewed distributions. The estimators are evaluated through simulations and applied to experimental data from olfactory receptor neurons in rats.","0899-7667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796577","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Since odors are made up of volatile compounds at low concentration, they can be used for olfactory-based identification. The article outlines the development of an olfactory-based AR system to help with the identification of maintenance issues using smell. The prototype comprises of three components: an electronic nose, a database and an AR application integrated with Microsoft HoloLens. After diagnosing an odor, the data is sent wirelessly through a local network to the HMD worn by the user. To validate the technology, four odors have been used, including engine oil, sun lotion, medical alcohol and perfume, to record behaviors and demonstrate the repeatability of the process.

When some of the sensory stimuli are missing in the virtual experience, it can break the illusion of being there in the environment and could lead to actions that deviate from normal behaviour. In this work, we added an olfactory cue in a well-documented historic hotel fire scenario that was recreated in VR, and examined the effects of the olfactory cue on human behaviour. We conducted a between subject study on 40 naive participants. Our results show that the addition of the olfactory cue could increase behavioural realism. We found that 80% of the studied actions for the VR with olfactory cue condition matched the ones performed by the survivors.

The high temporal resolution and non-invasiveness of Electroencephalogram (EEG) make it suitable to objectively study human preferences for odors. Effectively learning the temporal dynamics and spatial information from EEG is crucial for detecting odor-induced emotional valence. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture called Temporal Attention with Spatial Autoencoder Network (TASA) for predicting odor-induced emotions using EEG. TASA consists of a filter-bank layer, a spatial encoder, a time segmentation layer, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module, a multi-head self-attention (MSA) layer, and a fully connected layer. We improve upon the previous work by utilizing a two-phase learning framework, using the autoencoder module to learn the spatial information among electrodes by reconstructing the given input with a latent representation in the spatial dimension, which aims to minimize information loss compared to spatial filtering with CNN. The second improvement is inspired by the continuous nature of the olfactory process; we propose to use LSTM-MSA in TASA to capture its temporal dynamics by learning the intercorrelation among the time segments of the EEG. TASA is evaluated on an existing olfactory EEG dataset and compared with several existing deep learning architectures to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting olfactory-triggered emotional responses. Interpretability analyses with DeepLIFT also suggest that TASA learns spatial-spectral features that are relevant to olfactory-induced emotion recognition.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3399326","RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Fund, Singapore(grant numbers:A20G8b0102); Economic Development Board (EDB)-Wilmar Industrial Postgraduate Programme (IPP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528328","Deep learning;self-attention;electroencephalography;olfactory","Electroencephalography;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Long short term memory;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Odorants;Deep Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Attention;Male;Adult;Female;Smell;Young Adult","","","62","CCBYNCND","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Olfactory enhancement is important to many U.S. agencies where particular interests lie in canine detection for illicit drugs and explosives (DHS and DARPA); the perfume and food industry (DOC); and health-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and anosmia (CDC and NIH). Hence, the engineered synthesis and characterization of odor enhancing agents is of great potential importance. Physiological data provides evidence that Zn NPs (nominal diameter 1 nm - 2 nm) enhance the olfactory response in rats, however chemical characterization of these NPs is still necessary to fully understand the enhancement mechanism. Amino acids play a vital role in the signal transduction of neurotransmitters during an olfactory-induced response [2]. Vital information about NP-induced olfactory enhancements may be obtained by assessing interactions between NPs and underivatized amino acids, using capillary electrophoresis (CE) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Although the small size of these odor-enhancing Zn NPs present great challenges during analytical measurements, the size and concentration of these Zn NPs were estimated using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and found to be approximately 15 nm, in diameter. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) measurements revealed the presence of Fe (II) and Ni (II) in Zn NP dispersions, which may cause interferences with Zn (II) concentration and dissolution measurements. Zn NP and amino acid interactions, analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, showed that interactions were concentration dependent; higher concentrations of amino acids interacted with more Zn NPs, therefore further investigations of the interactions between NPs and biomolecules is necessary. This work has potential for the development of innovative technologies applicable to the advancement of canine detection, health and performance sciences.","","978-1-4673-8156-7","10.1109/NANO.2015.7388649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7388649","Nanocharacterization;Nanometrology;Zinc Nanoparticles;Olfaction","Zinc;Nanoparticles;Chemicals;Amino acids;Spectroscopy;Size measurement","","2","","8","IEEE","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The content is designed following principles of crossmodal correspondence between different sensory dimensions and delivered through olfactory, auditory and vibrotactile displays. The Quality of Experience is evaluated through both subjective (questionnaire) and objective means (eye gaze and heart rate). Results show that the auditory experience has an influence on the olfactory sensorial responses and lessens the perception of lingering odor.

The use of robot to discover and track the source of gas/chemical plume can replace traditional manual search, greatly reducing the risk and cost of search and improving efficiency. Most of the existing gas leakage source search methods are applied in two-dimensional environments, and for the scenarios where the plume is visible, the efficiency of searching and the success rate of source localization only relying on the olfaction is usually low. To this end, this paper proposes a plume finding and tracing method based on olfaction and vision with a drone in 3D outdoor environments. In the plume finding phase, olfactory information is combined with visual object detection in the 3D Spiral algorithm to improve plume finding efficiency. During the plume tracing phase, the drone performs a 3D Zigzag motion to rapidly approach the source of the gas leakage. If the plume is lost during tracing, the 3D Spiral algorithm, which combines olfactory and visual information, is used again in local area with a view to find the plume again.

EEG can be acquired, when the subject is exposed to external stimuli such as visual triggers or when the subject is resting. During biometric identification, expecting a person to be in a resting state, is not realistic; also external stimuli introduce artifacts in acquired EEG signals resulting in poor performance of EEG-based biometric systems. Odours evoke natural emotions in humans by associating strong memories with a particular smell. As a result, odours can be a potential stimulus for generating strong brainwaves; and unlike other triggers, odours can produce EEG without prominent artifacts. In this paper, an olfactory brainwave-based biometric system is proposed, where we model the subject-specific characteristics from the EEG signals captured using different odours as the trigger. We extract, from EEG signals, a set of handcrafted and diversified spectro-temporal features to train a biometric model. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset, show that it is possible to build an odour-independent biometric system with high-performance accuracy. Additionally, using odour-chemistry literature, we show that a small set of carefully chosen odours are sufficient to build a high-performance biometric system.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9360-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO58844.2023.10290059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290059","EEG Biometry;Subject Identification;EEG;Ol-factory brainwaves;Odour Stimulus","Visualization;Biometrics (access control);Biological system modeling;Olfactory;External stimuli;Signal processing;Brain modeling","","","","37","","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on our neurophysiological findings we simulated feature linking via synchronizations in networks of model neurons. The networks consisted of two one-dimensional layers of neurons, coupled in a forward direction via feeding connections and in lateral and backward directions via modulatory linking connections. The models' performance is demonstrated in examples of region linking with spatiotemporally varying inputs, where the rhythmic activities in response to an input, that initially are uncorrelated, become phase locked. We propose that synchronization is a general principle for the coding of associations in and among sensory systems and that at least two distinct types of synchronization do exist: stimulus-forced (event-locked) synchronizations support “crude instantaneous” associations and stimulus-induced (oscillatory) synchronizations support more complex iterative association processes. In order to bring neural linking mechanisms into correspondence with perceptual feature linking, we introduce the concept of the linking field (association field) of a local assembly of visual neurons. The linking field extends the concept of the invariant receptive field (RF) of single neurons to the flexible association of RFs in neural assemblies.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.1990.2.3.293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6795525","","","","256","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Over the past decades, classical gas recognition approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been widely applied in E-nose systems. In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) has revolutionized the field of E-nose, especially spiking neural network (SNN). In this paper, we investigate recent gas recognition methods for E-nose, and compare and analyze them in terms of algorithms and hardware implementations. We find each classical gas recognition method has a relatively fixed framework and a few parameters, which makes it easy to be designed and perform well with limited gas samples, but weak in multi-gas recognition under noise. While ANN-based methods obtain better recognition accuracy with flexible architectures and lots of parameters. However, some ANNs are too complex to be implemented in portable E-nose systems, such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast, SNN-based gas recognition methods achieve satisfying accuracy and recognize more types of gases, and could be implemented with energy-efficient hardware, which makes them a promising candidate in multi-gas identification.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2022.3166530","National Science and Technology Major Project; Minister of Science and Technology, China(grant numbers:2018AAA0103100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92164110,U19B2041); Beijing Engineering Research Center(grant numbers:BG0149); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756340","Gas recognition;electronic nose;artificial neural network;spiking neural network;energy-efficient hardware","Hardware;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis;Classification algorithms;Sensor arrays;Task analysis;Estimation","Algorithms;Electronic Nose;Gases;Neural Networks, Computer;Principal Component Analysis","88","","138","CCBY","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the absence of a stimulus, the Hodgkin-Huxley neurons are assumed to be tonically spiking. The methodology employed calls for 1) finding an input-output (I/O) equivalent description of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron and 2) devising a recovery algorithm for stimuli encoded with the I/O equivalent neuron(s). A Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with multiplicative coupling is I/O equivalent with an Integrate-and-Fire neuron with a variable threshold sequence. For bandlimited stimuli a perfect recovery of the stimulus can be achieved provided that a Nyquist-type rate condition is satisfied. A Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with additive coupling and deterministic conductances is first-order I/O equivalent with a Project-Integrate-and-Fire neuron that integrates a projection of the stimulus on the phase response curve. The stimulus recovery is formulated as a spline interpolation problem in the space of finite length bounded energy signals. A Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with additive coupling and stochastic conductances is shown to be first-order I/O equivalent with a Project-Integrate-and-Fire neuron with random thresholds. For stimuli modeled as elements of Sobolev spaces the reconstruction algorithm minimizes a regularized quadratic optimality criterion.

However, an excessively high concentration of target DNA molecules has a nonlinear effect on the measurements ̲ it causes saturation in the measurement intensities at the array spots.

The mobile sensing agents employed in the experiments have self localization capabilities and carry an electronic nose and a thermal anemometer. The proposed architecture allows integrating sparse olfaction data gathered by the mobile agents along their trajectories and dynamically estimate the spatial concentration of different odor fields. The data assimilation process is made centrally by a PC that polls periodically each robot through a RF network in order to get the data gathered during the previous acquisition period. The estimation of odor fields is made in two steps: first each agent estimates the odor mixture and concentration by means of a neural network-based regression algorithm that converts values from gas sensor space to the corresponding odor space. Then the sensed data is assimilated into an advection-diffusion model by means of a reduced order Kalman filter. In the current implementation the central controller, responsible for the maps estimation, specifies to each agent their target area to explore. The proposed architecture was validated with a set of experiments that demonstrated its ability to estimate and capture the dynamics of overlapping odor fields.

However, its conventional gas sensing is generally carried out based on a single estimator, which lacks a large-scale training set to train the models, leading to a low classification and regression accuracy. In this regard, this work explores an E-nose based on a gas sensor array, which predicts both types and concentrations of gases accurately and efficiently. Classical ensemble machine learning algorithms, XGBoost, and random forest (RF) are selected as candidates for designing the classifiers and regressors of the E-nose. The classifier recognizes six different volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while the regressor predicts the concentration of each gas component. The fivefold cross-validation method is used to search for the best training parameters of each model. Different from the previous works that solely relied on a single model, such as back-propagation neural network and decision tree, this work constructs a model system based on XGBoost-RF algorithms, which demonstrates superior performance. The model system achieves an accuracy of 96.0% using the XGBoost classifier and an average  ${R}^{{2}}$  score of 0.923 using the RF regressor in predicting six kinds of VOCs. Moreover, the novel model system has a high testing efficiency, with predicting time of 0.011 s in the classification process and 0.015 s in the regression process.

The odor of sweat is related to the apocrine glands found in human armpits. This experiment studied the classification of both genders based on daytime sweat in adult human armpits. The sampling method used an electronic nose (E-nose) system to collect the armpit sweat odor. The E-nose system sensor array consisted of seven sensors: TGS 822, TGS 2612, TGS 2620, TGS 826, TGS 2603, TGS 2600, and TGS 813. These sensors generate resistance ratio (Rs/Ro) values which are learned by the machine learning methods for classification and disease potential based on the volatile organic compound (VOC) in sweat. The study shows the male samples have higher amine gas than female samples, one of which is Trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is a compound that will be broken down into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a factor to various cardiovascular diseases.

Compared to animals, the nervous system in the human body possesses more intricate organization and utility. The nervous system anatomy has been understood progressively, yet the explanation at the cell level regarding complete information transmission is still lacking. Along the signal pathway toward the brain, an external stimulus first activates action potentials in the sensing neuron and these electric pulses transmit along the spinal nerve or cranial nerve to the neurons in the brain. Second, calcium elevation is triggered in the branch of astrocyte at the tripartite synapse. Third, the local calcium wave expands to the entire territory of the astrocyte. Finally, the calcium wave propagates to the neighboring astrocyte via gap junction channel. In our study, we integrate the existing mathematical model and biological experiments in each step of the signal transduction to establish a conceptual network model for the human nervous system. The network is composed of four layers and the communication protocols of each layer could be adapted to entities with different characterizations. We verify our simulation results against the available biological experiments and mathematical models and provide a test case of the integrated network.

Representation of the transient response shapes by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) of wavelet approximation coefficients provides an efficient procedure for denoising and feature extraction. The present work is concerned with identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by transient response analysis of polymer-coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. The sorption and diffusion kinetics of chemical molecules and polymer thickness determines the shapes of transient responses. The equilibration times for different vapor species are different for a given polymer coating. For a given exposure and purge cycle different vapor species with varied diffusion coefficients reach different stages of equilibration, hence loadings. Therefore, a pre-equilibrium termination of vapor exposure and purge durations can be expected to generate transient response shapes much richer in information compared to fully equilibrated condition. In this paper, we explore this aspect by carrying out a simulation based analysis of SAW sensor transients. The sense-and-purge cycle durations were varied for sensing of seven volatile organics by a polyisobutylene (PIB) coated SAW sensor. The transient signals were represented by DWT approximation coefficients based on Daubechies-2 mother wavelet. The vapor discrimination ability of an exposure and purge cycle was defined by the `class separability measure' calculated in the PCA generated feature space of DWT coefficients. The simulation experiments were carried out by varying exposure-and-purge durations and by adding different noise levels. It has been concluded that for obtaining best discrimination results in presence of noise the sense-and-purge duration must be optimized.","","978-1-4577-0720-9","10.1109/NCCISP.2012.6189680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189680","surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor transients;discrete wavelet decomposition;vapor recognition;sense-and-purge cycle optimization;vapor class separability","Sensors;Transient analysis;Surface acoustic waves;Polymers;Shape;Wavelet transforms;Actuators","","6","","35","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optimized array consists of subarrays of homogeneous (like) sensors contributing to a larger heterogeneous array of up to ten points (unlike sensors) in multidimensional sensor space. The optimization techniques presented here are linear, since the polymer sensors in their useful (low concentration) operating range exhibit linear and additive response characteristics. The optimization of these arrays produces maximum separability between analytes, demonstrating the trade-off between the addition of both information and variability induced by increasing the size of the heterogeneous array. Optimization results for sensing acetone, hexane, THF, toluene, and ethanol in the presence of interferents result in array sizes that are significantly less than the maximum available number of sensors (ten in the heterogeneous partition of the array). This result adds fuel to the argument that fewer sensors are better; the argument for more sensors, however, is also made in the context of the electronic nose systems where significant chemical diversity is required. Homogeneous subarrays of up to four elements each improve the separability of analytes in these optimized heterogeneous arrays by over 10% and also effectively flag broken or unhealthy sensors in a manner that is independent of analyte and concentration.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2002.800679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021058","","Polymers;Sensor arrays;Chemical sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Gas detectors;Multidimensional systems;Additives;Information analysis;Ethanol","","6","","47","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The so-called mushroom bodies have a set of output neurons, or classification functions, that compete with each other to encode a particular input. Strongly active output neurons depress or inhibit the remaining outputs without knowing which is correct or incorrect. Accordingly, we propose to use a classification function that embodies unselective inhibition and train it in the large margin classifier framework. Inhibition leads to more robust classifiers in the sense that they perform better on larger areas of appropriate hyperparameters when assessed with leave-one-out strategies. We also show that the classifier with inhibition is a tight bound to probabilistic exponential models and is Bayes consistent for 3-class problems. These properties make this approach useful for data sets with a limited number of labeled examples.

Malodor emission from livestock farms have been known as a significant source of odor nuisance resulting in increased complaints and environmental issues. E-nose technology has provided solutions to variety of these odorous problems with identification of the odor source and real-time monitoring of odor diffusion into the environment. This lab-developed electronic nose system consists of eight metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors as sensing materials, including a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor. The gas sensors were specifically selected for the main volatile compounds emitted from the livestock farms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as classification algorithms combined with data analysis techniques, which enable the recognition of different odor samples. In this work, five commercial poultry farms were selected for odor monitoring using the in-lab developed e-nose machine. The field experiments were conducted at various sites in the farms such as chicken houses, manure storage, biogas facilities, downwind points and in nearby villages. Odor concentrations were mainly detected behind the poultry house fan (Max. 11 odor unit). In addition, the malodor sources have been investigated with the e-nose in each poultry farm. High concentrations of malodor were identified in the poultry farms with poor manure handling system and poor building management. In conclusion, the e-nose technology has the potential of providing monitoring capabilities for livestock and agricultural industries. The use of e-nose device is recommended to apply in the livestock farms to reduce neighbourhood complaints and risk on workers' health and safety.","","978-1-6654-4122-3","10.1109/ICEAST52143.2021.9426281","National Nanotechnology Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426281","electronic nose;livestock farm;poultry farm;odor emission","Temperature sensors;Wind speed;Metals;Electronic noses;Agriculture;Real-time systems;Monitoring","","4","","12","IEEE","12 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These include process control and quality control in industries such as foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, perfumery and pharmaceutical. ENOSE is also crucial component in industrial safety (smoke and hazardous gas detection) as well as environmental pollution control. This paper deals with design of an intelligent ENOSE system for the identification of gas/odours using a sensor array and a neural network pattern classifier. Previous researchers have shown that the power of discrimination increases rapidly with the number of sensors in the array whose information potential is very large and the pattern recognition (PARC) method is a clever way to extract this information. The authors show in this paper with the powerful PARC technique, the need of larger array can be compensated. With this view, they design a neural classifier using two different learning approaches and train the network over the responses of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors exposed to hazardous vapours like diethyl sulphide (DES) and iso-octane (ISO). Dimensionality of the data set is varied from 1 to 8 by taking different number of sensors. It is found that for a backpropagation trained neural classifier, the optimum number of sensors required for satisfactory classification under noisy conditions is 4 to 5. This is a very limited range beyond which backpropagation has great difficulty in training the neural classifier even with repeated restarts and different weight initializations. To alleviate this problem, hybridization of soft computing tools like neural networks and genetic algorithms promises to provide the design of better intelligent system. The authors propose the use of a genetic algorithm based on a special MRX operator introduced by them and demonstrate very encouraging results with genetically trained neural network model even with larger as well as smaller numbers of sensors.","","0-7803-5812-0","10.1109/ICIT.2000.854142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854142","","Intelligent systems;Electronic noses;Sensor arrays;Intelligent sensors;Electrical equipment industry;Neural networks;Acoustic sensors;Industrial control;Intelligent networks;Surface acoustic waves","","3","","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For sensor fabrications, a cross-point structure is beneficial because of its low cost, while the readout interface circuit suffers from sneak currents, which can lead to enormous readout error. In this study, the developing electric olfaction system which integrates over 1,000 gas sensors was introduced. Compared to previous works, the array size tends to become large, and resistance values can be widely distributed. We employed the conventional voltage feedback method for the interface circuit because it can measure a wide range of resistance. However, since it constitutes the voltage divider circuit with the selected resistor and the reference resistance by an op-amp unity gain feedback, the readout accuracy is affected by its large load sensor resistance. Therefore, a calibration technique for the voltage feedback method was proposed. The feedback error caused by the load resistance and op-amp nonidealities was analyzed with a simplified circuit, in which circuit parameters such as an array scale, a reference resistance, and an op-amp output impedance were variable. The sneak currents were estimated in the calibration by utilizing the op-amp input difference, and their effects were eliminated. The simulation results showed that the readout error of 32×32 resistive array with 10% distributed resistance could be decreased from around 3% to less than 0.005%. The dependency of the readout accuracy on an op-amp's gain input offset voltage was evaluated systematically to apply the calibration to a practical system.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3081160","Research Program for Next Generation Young Scientists of Network Joint Research Center for Materials and Devices Dynamic Alliance for Open Innovation Bridging Human Environment and Materials(grant numbers:20205019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432916","Driving power;gas sensing;op-amp;resistive sensor array;software calibration","Sensors;Resistance;Gas detectors;Electrical resistance measurement;Sensor arrays;Resistors;Calibration","","3","","29","IEEE","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One aim of artificial intelligence is to build ""meaning machines"", that can initiate actions in the context of broadly assigned goals and learn about their environments from the received results of their own actions. A prototypical device is described that is based in experimental nonlinear brain dynamics and implemented with differential equations. Studies of the neurodynamics of sensory cortices during conditioned responses of trained animals to learned stimuli have supported the development of a mathematical model of the nonlinear dynamic processes by which meaning is constructed. A second order linear ordinary differential equation with compression of output by an asymmetric static sigmoid function describes each node as a neural population. The nodes are coupled by weighted connections, and the set of equations is solved by numerical integration. The parameters are optimized to give aperiodic attractors simulating observed brain activity. The attractors are stabilized with biologically modeled additive noise.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.638197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=638197","","Differential equations;Biological system modeling;Learning;Artificial intelligence;Context;Prototypes;Neurodynamics;Animals;Mathematical model;Nonlinear equations","","3","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, statistical analyses are employed to characterize the sensor response to various gases and to classify each individual gas. However, because the sorption-desorption cycle can require a long time to come to equilibrium, the initial vectors do not contain much unique information.

However, it is often hard to find liver cancer early because signs and symptoms often do not appear until it is in its later stages. Small liver tumors are hard to be detected on a physical exam. In fact, there are no widely recommended screening tests for liver cancer in people who are not at increased risk. Human exhaled breath contains a mixture of hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including some implicit information with diseases. As a result, in recent years, electronic nose has become a widely used tool for the diagnosis of various diseases. In the paper, we evaluated the feasibility of an electronic nose in discriminating liver cancer from healthy controls. Exhaled breaths of liver cancer and healthy controls were first collected. And then, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to achieve the main features. Liner discriminant analysis (LDA), distance discriminant analysis (DDA) and support vector machine (SVM) were respectively applied to construct classifier to analyze exhaled breath. Results showed a satisfactory identification rate of liver cancer subject. SVM could get a higher recognition accuracy than other methods. The recognition accuracy could reach as high as 91.67% based on the single sensor signal analysis. As a result, we believe that electronic nose may become a potential tool for early diagnose liver cancer in future, due to its rapid, simple, cost-less and noninvasive.","","978-1-5386-1937-7","10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302211","Electronic nose;Liver cancer;Exhaled breath;SVM","Cancer;Liver;Electronic noses;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Support vector machines","","2","","14","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The measurements of the chemical sensors' impedance is an innovative technique that allows highlighting different adsorption mechanisms taking place when the sensors are exposed to gases. Of course, impedance analyzers are commercially available, but they usually make measurements on only one device at time and they are very expensive. The proposed PC-based impedance analyzer is a versatile one and shows good performances for gas-sensing applications. A digital correction technique is used in this work to improve the impedance measurement accuracy of each channel of the gas-sensing system (eight sensors /spl rarr/ eight channels), in order to compensate for the conditioning electronics response. The latter is evaluated in a characterization procedure. A linear black box two-port model is used to take into account crosstalk, amplitude, and phase distortions. Two different techniques to evaluate the response of the measurement system are discussed in this paper, and experimental results are presented on both the measure of reference impedances and on the measure of chemical sensors.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2004.827319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1299136","","Impedance measurement;Chemical sensors;Sensor arrays;Distortion measurement;Sensor systems;Performance evaluation;Frequency;Gases;Time measurement;Performance analysis","","1","","19","IEEE","18 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach suggests that there exists a strict relationship in chaotic systems between dynamic reconstruction, optimization, and stabilization intended as a relaxation process in as much as they are all functions of an inner self-correlation process.

Artificial odor discrimination system is constructed to overcome the limitation of the already existing sensory test systems. Authors have developed an electronic odor discrimination system by using 4 quartz-resonator sensitive membranes as the sensors and had fundamental resonance frequencies 10 MHz. In recognizing and classifying the output pattern, the system used back propagation (BP) neural network as the pattern recognizer. This system can recognize the limited odor mixtures. The capability of the system can be amended by improving the hardware and changing the software of pattern classifier. This paper proposes a new sensing system using 16 multiple quartz resonator sensors array and basic resonance frequencies 20 MHz. Also modify various neural network called probabilistic neural network (PNN) and fuzzy-neuro learning vector quantization (FLVQ) as the automated pattern recognition system. The purpose of the recent study is to construct an artificial odor discrimination system for recognizing the fragrance mixtures.

For instance, cockroaches rely on the temporal changes in the odour concentration to perform odour localisation, which has proven a highly challenging task for robots. In this paper, we present a new mathematical model, the dynamic Braitenberg vehicle, that incorporates the temporal rate of change of the stimulus in the source seeking behavior. Our theoretical analysis of the model stability shows that including a term dependent on the temporal evolution of the stimulus significantly improves the behaviour of the closed-loop system compared to its reactive counterpart. The paper illustrates the validity of the new model and the theoretical results of the stability analysis through a set of simulations.

The slime mold is capable of sensing tactile, chemical, and optical stimuli and converting them to characteristic patterns of its electrical potential oscillations. The electrical responses to stimuli may propagate along protoplasmic tubes for distances exceeding tens of centimeters, as impulses in neural pathways do. A slime mold makes decisions about its propagation direction based on information fusion from thousands of spatially extended protoplasmic loci, similarly to a neuron collecting information from its dendritic tree. The analogy is distant yet inspiring. We speculate on whether alternative—would-be—nervous systems can be developed and practically implemented from the slime mold. We uncover analogies between the slime mold and neurons, and demonstrate that the slime mold can play the roles of primitive mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, and chemoreceptors; we also show how the Physarum neural pathways develop.

To deploy SNNs in ubiquitous computing systems, signal encoding of sensors is crucial for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Using inertial sensor readings for gym activity recognition as a case study, this work comprehensively evaluates four main encoding schemes and deploys the corresponding SNN on the neuromorphic processor Loihi2 for postdeployment encoding assessment. Rate encoding, time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, binary encoding, and delta modulation are evaluated using metrics such as average fire rate, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), classification accuracy, robustness, and inference latency and energy. In this case study, the TTFS encoding required the lowest firing rate (2%) and achieved a comparative accuracy (89%) although it was the least robust scheme against error spikes (over 20% accuracy drop with 0.1 noisy spike rate).

This work introduces a novel approach towards instantaneous and selective discrimination of gases based on their unique ionization properties: electric breakdown voltage and field ionization current-voltage characteristic. Synthesized gold and silicon nanowires, covered with sharp nanoscale whiskers, exhibited anomalously strong discharge and field ionization characteristics at very low bias voltages.

It has been recognized that fault detection based on the k nearest neighbor rules (kNN) can effectively handle some of the characteristics of the gas sensor process, such as multimode bulk trajectories and nonlinearities. However, the computational complexity and storage space involved in kNN's neighbor search prevents it from being monitored online, especially for high-dimensional situations. In order to solve this problem, Before the implementation of kNN rules to fault detection, we reduce dimensions by principal component analysis (PCA) and propose a K-fold cross-verification method in the training stage of the model to learn from multiple directions, which plays a good role in improving the accuracy of fault diagnosis. This method enables the verification set to traverse all the data sets during the division of the training set and the test set, thus avoiding the problem of local minima to a certain extent. In the specified range of K values, the smaller the K value is, the fewer the nearest neighbors are, and the more useful training samples can not be included, resulting in the increase of false recognition rate; the K value is too large and the noise significantly affects the error rate; the optimal K value is obtained by cross-verification K nearest neighbor algorithm, so that the error rate of pattern recognition is the lowest. The practical application shows that this method can realize the on-line diagnosis and location of array gas sensor faults, and can be applied to other similar systems.","2189-8723","978-1-7281-3380-5","10.1109/ICIIBMS46890.2019.8991492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8991492","K-nearest neighbor;machine learning;k-fold cross-validation;fault detection;principal component analysis","","","","","14","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since gas sensors are susceptible to aging, chemical poisoning and other factors, the collected data are prone to drift. The paper proposed a Bi-GRU-based Encoder-Decoder framework and introduced a spatio-temporal attention mechanism (SABG for short). The algorithm extracts the feature information of e-nose data through both temporal and spatial dimensions, which can effectively counteract the sensor drift phenomenon with the highest classification accuracy of 91.45%. To demonstrate the reliability of the algorithm, this paper uses a publicly available dataset produced by the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine or UCI) for experiments. In addition, this paper compares various advanced gas sensor drift compensation algorithms such as PCA, CC-PCA, OSC, SVM-rbf, etc. The experimental results show that the SABG model is able to simulate the dynamic behavior of the input sequence, thus improving the accuracy and generalization ability.

Recent studies have identified that volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers for TB diagnosis exist in breath, skin and urine samples, opening the door to the rapid non-invasive diagnosis of TB patients. Unfortunately, current VOC sensing approaches are not available in a portable format for in-field real-time diagnosis of TB patients. Here we present an insect Odorant Receptor (OR) based biosensing approach for the detection of TB biomarker VOCs. We validate this approach using three Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptors: DmOr42a and DmOr69a for the breath TB biomarkers 2-butanone and nonanal, respectively, and DmOr35a for the skin TB biomarker hexyl butyrate. We overexpress, purify and reconstitute each receptor with DmOrco into liposomes. We then use fuse each DmOrX/Orco liposome with planar lipid bilayers to enable ion channel measurements. By directly monitoring the change in electrical current through the planar lipid bilayer we can detect binding of each biomarker VOC to their respective receptor. Furthermore, we show with DmOr69a/Orco that it is possible to detect a VOC biomarker at the nM (ppB) concentration, providing the sensitivity required for disease diagnosis in biological samples. This study is the first step towards the development of an OR based electrochemical biosensor for the rapid point-of-care diagnosis of TB and other disease states which have unique volatile signatures.","","979-8-3503-9513-6","10.1109/BioSensors61405.2024.10712718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10712718","volatile organic compound;insect odorant receptor;biosensor, tuberculosis;diagnostic","Volatile organic compounds;Sensitivity;Tuberculosis;Insects;Point of care;Biomarkers;Lipidomics;Skin;Sensors;Biosensors","","","","27","IEEE","16 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, over 250,000 brain cells are generated every minute in a two months old fetus. These cells slither across the brain, seeking out their proper destination, and then send out billions of axons, similarly to new branches of massive trees in a forest. The axons make connections with other brain cells, and a single neuron may have 100,000 connections with other neurons. This connection building phase is followed by a pruning phase. Many of these synapses will die (e.g. only half of the 200 billions generated neurons will survive to adulthood). If the pruning of the synapses is not efficient, then the aberrant connectivity can lead to diseases like schizophrenia. The second hypothetical mechanism underlying schizophrenia can be the low level of local connections between neurons (excessive synaptic pruning). This two hypotheses are investigated experimentally in this paper. In order to do this investigation, we simulate the brain biological system by introducing a neural network model that embeds two sub-systems (zones) within it. In this model, which tries to reproduce the piriform cortex, we perform changes to the number of connections (by increasing or decreasing them). By modifying the connectivity, we attempt to simulate the pruning process which may cause schizophrenia. The analyzed signals which describe these two zones are EEGs. We have investigated the level of chaos and the synchronization between these two zones. Both of these hypotheses have an impact on the level of chaos, but the excessive synaptic pruning hypothesis has a higher impact on the system dynamics regarding the nonlinear interdependence measure, than the insufficient pruning hypothesis","0840-7789","0-7803-8885-2","10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1557304","","Neurons;Biological system modeling;Brain modeling;Brain cells;Nerve fibers;Chaos;Fetus;Diseases;Biological systems;Biological neural networks","","","","14","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To understand this complexity, the field of connectomics is mapping and analyzing the nervous systems of many different animal species to help elucidate the fundamental principles of brain function. Focusing on the mammalian brain, in this study we analyzed the mouse connectome using a graph theoretical approach to uncover the critical brain regions and connections of the network. Vulnerability analysis conducts simulated deletions of each region and connection to measure each component's specific contributions to the brain as an entire system - thus it not only captures the local network properties of each component, but their effects on other regions and connections as well. Our analysis identified 8 regions and 38 connections as being critical to the network information processing. We also found that most of the critical connections and brain regions were interconnected with each other. Moreover, this interconnectivity organized into four main groups that can be categorized based on known neurobiological function: most notably, olfaction, learning and memory, higher-level motor control and cognition, and lower-level autonomic and motor control. The vulnerability result thus suggests that these functional components appear to be the most fundamental and thus most important for the mouse's survival. The findings of this study suggest that the vulnerability analysis approach can be used to uncover and characterize brain complexity, including ultimately the human brain.","","978-1-5386-0882-1","10.1109/BMEiCON.2017.8229102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229102","Graph theory network analysis;Connectome;Neural modeling;Neural computation;Sensorimotor and Cognitive processing","Neurons;Mice;Complexity theory;Information processing;Laplace equations","","","","30","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, real recurrent neural networks are abundant and continually receive information-rich inputs from the outside environment or other parts of the brain. We examine how feedforward networks of spiking neurons with delayed global feedback process information about temporally changing inputs. We show that the network behavior is more synchronous as well as more correlated with and phase-locked to the stimulus when the stimulus frequency is resonant with the inherent frequency of the neuron or that of the network oscillation generated by the feedback architecture. The two eigenmodes have distinct dynamical characteristics, which are supported by numerical simulations and by analytical arguments based on frequency response and bifurcation theory. This distinction is similar to the class I versus class II classification of single neurons according to the bifurcation from quiescence to periodic firing, and the two modes depend differently on system parameters. These two mechanisms may be associated with different types of information processing.","0899-7667","","10.1162/0899766054615680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6788254","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In this study, 23 subjects experienced pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral odors while their electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded. Two independent three-class classifiers were trained and tested, using EEG or ECG features. The results reveal a significant increase in the classification performance when EEG features were used (Cohen's kappa k = 0.44 ± 0.14; p <; 0.001). The results also indicate that it is possible to automatically classify the perception of unpleasant odors using EEG signals, but the classification performance decreases significantly when classifying between pleasant and neutral odors.

One of the challenges in realizing MOP is an appropriate multilabel classifier from the high-dimensional sensor responses. Here, we propose a novel aroma-type (AT) oriented MOP method, which is an MOP method of multiple AT. Wherein, the method designed an intelligent perception of multiple ATs based on a convolutional neural network (IPMAT-CNN), in which an olfactory information-shared mechanism was introduced to enhance the feature extraction of the network. In addition, by analyzing the molecular correlation between multiple ATs, a matrix addition method was designed in IPMAT-CNN to strengthen the information on adjacent ATs. These designs effectively improved the accuracy of model detection. At last, IPMAT-CNN successfully sensed and recognized seven ATs of 38 monomer flavors. The effectiveness of IPMAT-CNN was evaluated by four baseline models [classifier chain based on random forest classifier (CC-RF), label powerset based on random forest classifier (LP-RF), multilabel decision tree (ML-DT), and multilabel  ${k}$ -nearest neighbor (ML-kNN)]. The results showed that the IPMAT-CNN had the best performance with a 0.0636 hamming loss, a 93.65% accuracy, and a 0.8149 mean average precision (mAP) value for classifying the seven ATs.

In particular, during learning of overlapping input patterns, recall of previously stored patterns can interfere with the learning of new patterns. Most associative memory models avoid this difficulty by ignoring the effect of previously modified connections during learning, thereby clamping activity to the patterns to be learned. Here I propose that the effects of acetylcholine in cortical structures may provide a neuropsychological mechanism for this clamping. Recent brain slice experiments have shown that acetylcholine selectively suppresses excitatory intrinsic fiber synaptic transmission within the olfactory cortex, while leaving excitatory afferent input unaffected. In a computational model of olfactory cortex, this selective suppression, applied during learning, prevents interference from previously stored patterns during the learning of new patterns. Analysis of the model shows that the amount of suppression necessary to prevent interference depends on cortical parameters such as inhibition and the threshold of synaptic modification, as well as input parameters such as the amount of overlap between the patterns being stored.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.1993.5.1.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796613","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Acquiring high-precision respiratory signals often requires additional equipment, increasing the experimental burden, particularly in free-moving paradigms. However, within the current neuroscience paradigm, we have not yet found a non-invasive method for obtaining the respiratory signals of laboratory animals. To minimize surgical trauma to experimental animals, this paper introduces a ConvLSTM-based decoding method, which uses the LFP from the olfactory bulb (OB) region of animals to accurately decode respiratory signals. After validating the effectiveness of the ConvLSTM method through comparative experiments, we further investigated the factors influencing the model's decoding performance. The Gamma frequency band exhibited the best decoding results, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16±0.09, which may be related to the causal direction from respiratory signals to Gamma rhythms. Additionally, the ConvLSTM model demonstrated strong trend prediction capabilities in multi-sequence point predictions and forward predictions, despite a slight decline in single-point prediction accuracy. Extensive validation on publicly available datasets indicates that the ConvLSTM-based respiratory decoding approach is highly applicable, offering a non-invasive alternative for respiratory signal acquisition in animal studies.","","978-3-8007-6290-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10830700","","","","","","","","7 Jan 2025","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

When an odorant is captured by an OR (OR56a) expressed on Sf21 cell, calcium indicator protein (GCaMP6) is activated by calcium ion flowing through the OR into the cell. The intensity change of the fluorescent light can be regarded as a sensor output. Since fluorescent light from the cell was very weak, the measurement should be done in the dark condition. The measurement quality deteriorates if the ambient light is included. Thus, a lock-in measurement technique was incorporated to the system to overcome the problem of the ambient light together with the fluorescent image. The lock-in technique enables the detection of light synchronous with the modulated excitation light under the ambient light. This technique is also useful to improve the signal to noise ratio. In this work, we were successful in the detection of 500 nM geosmin even under the condition with the ambient light, whereas it was not clearly detected by the system without lock-in technique.","","978-1-4799-8203-5","10.1109/ICSENS.2015.7370351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370351","cell-based odor sensor;fluorescent microscopy;lock-in amplifier;biosensor","Fluorescence;Fluorescent lamps;Frequency modulation;Cameras;Instruments;Biosensors","","1","","10","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it is necessary to research the method of interference suppression for realizing the long-term and stable detection. This paper proposes a sparse reconstruction domain transfer (SRDT) method to suppress the interference in E-nose. The proposed method is to find the optimal subspace for each dataset, and sparsely reconstruct the transformed data after transforming to the optimal subspace, which can realize the knowledge transfer in the data domains with and without interference information. Three different datasets of E-nose are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, including the benchmark sensor drift data, the dataset collected by three identical sets of E-nose systems and the dataset of background interference caused by carrier gas. The average recognition rate is 92.97% in the first dataset. The recognition rate is 93.75% and 90.27% separately for the two tasks of the second dataset, and 85.16% and 84.62% separately for the two tasks of the third dataset.

In this paper, we propose a self-expression ELM (SeELM) for olfactory target/background detection. Specially, it is known that metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor in electronic nose (E-nose) can response to several target gases and interferences (background) simultaneously, which would seriously deteriorate the detection accuracy of target gases. Considering that there are numerous interferences in real-world application scenario, it is impossible for us to collect them. With a prior knowledge that the target gases samples can be easily collected, a novel SeELM method is proposed to address this issue. The idea is represented as two aspects. First, the target gases being detected by an E-nose can be fixed as invariant information, which is utilized to construct a self-expression model. Second, with the self-expression detector, the unknown backgrounds can be easily recognized in terms of the violation. Experimental results proved that the proposed SeELM method is significantly effective for Target/Background detection in E-nose.","","978-1-5090-4240-1","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850052","Extreme learning machine;self-expression;background detection;electronic nose","Gases;Encoding;Interference;Training;Electronic noses;Gas detectors;Training data","","1","","19","IEEE","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These receptor cells were stimulated by odors normally secreted by the female which have been shown to act as powerful sex attractants to the male. The computer program stores the time interval between nerve spikes and 30 100-µs samples of the waveform of each spike detected. An ensemble of up to 1000 sets of samples can be stored in the course of an experiment on a 32K-word magnetic disk, through a data channel facility. A statistic is calculated on the sampled data for each spike in the ensemble. The range in values of this statistic is used to characterize the data by plotting a histogram of the nerve-spike parameter. This display can then be partitioned so as to identify the two units of interest. On the basis of this identification, a distinct time series for each receptor is computed and filed on the minitape for further data analysis.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1973.9334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1451264","","Microcomputers;Timing;Neurons;Statistics;Computer displays;Laboratories;Electrodes;Frequency;Nervous system;Antenna measurements","","24","","9","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

LTP increases synaptic efficacy by incremental “steps,” up to a “ceiling” at which additional bursts of afferent stimulation cause no further potentiation. Endogenous and exogenous agents have been shown to modulate these two paramenters of LTP, raising the question of the functional implications associated with the sizes of steps and ceiling. We provide an analytical treatment of the effects of these two physiological LTP parameters on the behavior of simulated olfactory (piriform) cortex target cells in response to a range of inputs. A target cell's receptive field, i.e., the set of input patterns to which the cell responds, is broadened with potentiation of the cell's synapses, and is broadened more when the LTP step size is smaller, and when the LTP ceiling is higher. Moreover, the effects of step size and ceiling interact, and their joint relationship to receptive field breadth is nonlinear. Values of step size and ceiling are identified that balance the tradeoff between learning rate and receptive field breadth for particular sensory recognition tasks, and these model values are compared to corresponding known and inferred physiological values.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.1996.8.4.328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793289","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Our purpose was to create a device for researchers who are conducting initial research on rat models. The device allows researchers to provide a humidified source of oxygen safely to an anesthetized laboratory rat for up to six hour experimental sessions. Furthermore, the humidifier allows the user to manually control the humidity by a simple valve. In addition, the humidifier increases and decreases the humidity by slow increments to ensure the safety of the lab animal as well as the accuracy of the humidity readings. Finally, the design consists of two ports where a gaseous or liquid form odorant may be administered and evaluated for olfactory fMRI information. This device is a user-friendly, user-safe, and animal-safe method of odorant administration for fMRI studies.

Twenty-eight participants were invited to take part in our experiment, evenly split into a control and experimental group. Time and number of failed/successful attempts were recorded. A significant difference was found, in terms of time taken, between the experimental and the control groups, as determined by independent sample t-test.

The derivative of a MOX gas sensors signal is considered to be associated with gas fluctuations, thereby enabling the estimation of the distance to the source. Derivatively-based methods require the calculation of differentials and can generate large amounts of data. In this study, a distance estimation method for odor sources is proposed based on spike encoding and the number of spike clusters with the cubic polynomial model. Results show that the proposed method reduces the data volume while retaining effective information. For the distance estimation of a sensor in a turbulent environment, the proposed method performs well in estimating source distance. The RMSE is 0.109 m. In conclusion, the proposed spike-based source estimation method demonstrates effective distance estimation with a single sensor for gas sources.

To address this, in the present study participants were exposed to malodor of high and low intensity, with and without a pleasant masking stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) analyses have revealed that malodor masking induces significant modulations in cortical activity over frontal, central and parietal cortex, supported primarily by θ and β frequency band oscillations, which likely represent attention and affective neural processing, while also involving δ and α band oscillations. The findings pave the way for EEG-based detection of malodor suppression, which can support the design of effective olfactory masking techniques to combat odor annoyance in domestic and public environments.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781996","Olfaction;Malodor;Cognition;Brain;Electroencephalography","Neuroscience;Frequency modulation;Olfactory;Electroencephalography;Engineering in medicine and biology;Oscillators","Humans;Electroencephalography;Male;Adult;Odorants;Female;Wearable Electronic Devices;Young Adult;Brain;Smell","","","26","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After realizing the limitation of olfaction organ and the action mechanism of odor concentration on olfaction organ, the idea of step-size basing upon the resolution power of gas sensor emerged. Furthermore, the thought of accumulation of micro steps was proposed. Computer simulation proved that search travel strictly determined by accumulated micro moves is effective. The thought of accumulation was embedded in classical zigzag-path algorithm and hexagon-path algorithm. Simulation proved that the new zigzag-path algorithm is effective and the new hexagon-path algorithm is even better. Both new algorithms were proved having good functions.

Models can also act as a bridge between different levels of neuronal organization. The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to provide a link between behavior and underlying neural mechanisms. Depending on the specific aim of the model, there are different levels of neuronal organization at which the model can be set. Models are constructed at the microscopic (molecular and cellular), macroscopic level (local populations or systems), or dynamical systems level. Apart from purely computational models, hybrid networks are being developed in which biological neurons are connected in vitro to computer simulated neurons.

On the other hand, if the robot detects the presence of gas while wandering around the area, it turns toward the direction of the wind that carries the gas.

Thus, the hyper-connectivity network (HCN) has been widely used to reveal high-order interactions among multiple brain regions. However, existing HCN models are essentially spatial HCN, which reflect the spatial relevance of multiple brain regions, but ignore the temporal correlation among multiple time points. Furthermore, the majority of HCN construction and learning frameworks are limited to using a single template, while the multi-template carries richer information. To address these issues, we first employ multiple templates to parcellate the rs-fMRI into different brain regions. Then, based on the multi-template data, we propose a spatio-temporal weighted HCN (STW-HCN) to capture more comprehensive high-order temporal and spatial properties of brain activity. Next, a novel deep fusion model of multi-template called spatio-temporal weighted multi-hypergraph convolutional network (STW-MHGCN) is proposed to fuse the STW-HCN of multiple templates, which extracts the deep interrelation information between different templates. Finally, we evaluate our method on the ADNI-2 and ABIDE-I datasets for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) analysis.

We next derive a variational formulation that jointly infers the mode of data, i.e., inlier or outlier, as well as hyperparameters by maximizing a lower bound of the true log marginal likelihood. Compared to previous robust GPR, our formulation approximates the exact posterior distribution. The inducing variable approximation and stochastic variational inference are further introduced to our variational framework, extending our model to large-scale data.

Ambient assisted solutions can be opted for in monitoring air quality in indoor environments by rapidly identifying health endangering gases. Industrial solutions are not appropriate for such a purpose because these incur high cost and long analysis time. In this paper, we present a wireless electronic nose system, containing commercially available gas sensors, to identify toxic gases in the indoor environment. Rapid identification with a reduced computational power and memory requirement is the major challenge to adopting a wireless electronic nose as an ambient assisted solution. Recently, logarithmic time encoding model based spike latency coding schemes have been used for hardware friendly implementation. However, these involve regression operation and a large memory requirement. In this paper, we use transient features to form spike codes instead of the logarithmic time encoding model, and as a result, we not only eliminate the requirement of regression but also achieve rapid identification with reduced memory size. A confidence coefficient is defined to examine the correctness of our approach, and if its value is below a certain threshold then a new sample can be collected for the classification decision.

Here we consider associative memories with boundedly noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as the internal noise level is below a specified threshold, the error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprising, we show that internal noise improves the performance of the recall phase while the pattern retrieval capacity remains intact: the number of stored patterns does not reduce with noise (up to a threshold). Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis.

The results of the k-means algorithms can be achieved 98.3% of correct classification which also show the high ability of the EN to detect the early stage of fire from various sources accurately.","1098-7576","0-7803-7898-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1224082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224082","","Fires;Gas detectors;Artificial neural networks;Smoke detectors;Temperature sensors;Electronic noses;Error correction;Backpropagation;Testing;Training data","","8","","4","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This rhythmic activity suggests that the coherence of neural populations is a crucial feature of cortical dynamics (Gray, 1994). Using both simulations and a theoretical coupled oscillator approach, we demonstrate that the spike frequency adaptation seen in many pyramidal cells plays a subtle but important role in the dynamics of cortical networks. Without adaptation, excitatory connections among model pyramidal cells are desynchronizing.

The recent discovery of stimulus-dependent, spatially-coherent oscillations in primary visual cortex of the cat has led to suggestions of neural information encoding schemes based on phase and/or frequency variation. To explore the mechanisms underlying this behavior and their possible functional consequences, we have developed a realistic neural model, based on structural features of visual cortex, which replicates observed oscillatory phenomena. In the model, this oscillatory behavior emerges directly from the structure of the cortical network and the properties of its intrinsic neurons; however, phase coherence is shown to be an average phenomenon seen only when measurements are made over multiple trials. Because average coherence does not ensure synchrony of firing over the course of single stimuli, oscillatory phase may not be a robust strategy for directly encoding stimulus-specific information. Instead, the phase and frequency of cortical oscillations may reflect the coordination of general computational processes within and between cortical areas. Under this interpretation, coherence emerges as a result of horizontal interactions that could be involved in the formation of receptive field properties.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.1991.3.4.498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796618","","","","4","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Although graph convolutional networks are widely applied for discovering brain connection patterns that point to disease conditions, the potential of connection patterns that arise from multiple imaging modalities has yet to be fully realized. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal sparse interpretable GCN framework (SGCN) for the detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our experimentation, SGCN learned the sparse regional importance probability to find signature regions of interest (ROIs), and the connective importance probability to reveal disease-specific brain network connections. We evaluated SGCN on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with multi-modal brain images and demonstrated that the ROI features learned by SGCN were effective for enhancing AD status identification. The identified abnormalities were significantly correlated with AD-related clinical symptoms. We further interpreted the identified brain dysfunctions at the level of large-scale neural systems and sex-related connectivity abnormalities in AD/MCI. The salient ROIs and the prominent brain connectivity abnormalities interpreted by SGCN are considerably important for developing novel biomarkers. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the network-based disorder via multi-modal diagnosis and offer the potential for precision diagnostics.

However, there is still inadequate discussion on the effect of the amount of odor acquisition, which is an important factor in determining the state of searching behavior, on CPT performance. To address this issue, we first designed and developed an insect-inspired odor-intake device. To evaluate the performance of the device, we conducted CPT experiments in an outdoor environment. An insect-inspired CPT algorithm that relies only on odor information was adopted because the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the odor intake device. As a result of the outdoor CPT experiment, it was found that by setting the appropriate combination of the odor intake state and the behavioral state, certain search performances can be maintained even in highly unpredictable environments, such as outdoors.

Using topological analysis algorithms, we found that HC brain was divided into 4 modules; AD brain was divided into 4 modules; PDD brain was divided into 6 modules; and DLB brain was divided into 10 modules, which demonstrated differences in these dementia subtypes. We also found that right thalamus area was scattered in all dementia subtypes. After using the seed point correlation analysis, it can be seen that the connections between right thalamus and subcortical, frontal gyrus were enhanced and the connections with the occipital gyrus was attenuated in dementia subtypes. As a result, findings in this paper are expected to be useful for neuroscientists to further understand the pathology of AD, PDD and DLB.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512655","","Dementia;Thalamus;Correlation;Positron emission tomography;Orbits;Correlation coefficient","Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Dementia;Glucose;Humans;Lewy Body Disease;Parkinson Disease","1","","15","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first experiment was a pretest in which 71 normal subjects were asked to rate 185 odorants in terms of intensity, familiarity, hedonicity, and comestibility and to name the odorants. This pretest was necessary to select the most appropriate stimuli for the different cognitive tasks of the second experiment. The second one was a PET experiment in which 15 normal subjects were scanned using the water bolus method to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the performance in three conditions. In the first (perceptual) condition, subjects were asked to judge whether an odor was familiar or not. In the second (semantic) condition, subjects had to decide whether an odor corresponded to a comestible item or not. In the third (detection) condition, subjects had to judge whether the perceived stimulus was made of an odor or was just air. It was hypothetized that the three tasks were hierarchically organized from a superficial detection level to a deep semantic level. Odorants were presented with an air-flow olfactometer, which allowed the stimulations to be synchronized with breathing. Subtraction of activation images obtained between familiarity and control judgments revealed that familiarity judgments were mainly associated with the activity of the right orbito-frontal area, the subcallosal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate (Brodmann's areas 11, 25, 47, 9, and 32, respectively). The comestibility minus familiarity comparison showed that comestibility judgments selectively activated the primary visual areas. In contrast, a decrease in rCBF was observed in these same visual areas for familiarity judgments and in the orbitofrontal area for comestibility judgments. These results suggest that orbito-frontal and visual regions interact in odor processing in a complementary way, depending on the task requirements.","0898-929X","","10.1162/089892999563166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6788049","","","","1","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The fMRI signals in the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 (medial PFC) and in regions to which it projects, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, were higher when decisions were being made compared with ratings, implicating these regions in decision-making. Decision-making about affective value was related to larger signals in the dorsal part of medial area 10 and the agranular insula, whereas decisions about intensity were related to larger activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral PFC), ventral premotor cortex, and anterior insula. For comparison, the mid orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) had activations related not to decision-making but to subjective pleasantness ratings, providing a continuous representation of affective value.

One major strength of the object-oriented approach is its highly flexible data modeling power offering an elegant way of representing complex genomic objects. The approach's major weakness includes the lack of generic way of accessing complex objects. The strength of the relational approach is its full provision of SQL.

Several technologies including mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis have traditionally been used to study proteins. These technologies rely on proteins' masses to characterize and/or identify them. Once identified, the discovered proteins' are often analyzed for their functional relevance. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to studying protein function directly, based on protein mass. By analyzing proteins with similar mass ranges (bins), we discovered that certain biological functions are associated with specific mass bins more frequently than would be expected by chance. Biological functional classes found in this manner could be seen across the three examined organisms: human, worm and fly. We found no sequence-based homology across significant mass-function proteins in the three different organisms. This investigation leads to useful property that the mass-based biological functional classes are preserved across the organisms. Thus, this paper describes a potential constraint for evolution of similar function based on mass constraints. Finally, this work yields a roadmap for experimental design for functional exploration of proteomes in mass-based technologies such as gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.","","978-1-4244-1509-0","10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375545","Proteomics methods;Mass Spectrometry;Functional Genomics","Joining processes;Proteins;Organisms;Humans;Mass spectroscopy;Electrokinetics;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Evolution (biology);Design for experiments","","","","19","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, most existing imputation methods either overlook the spatial information between spots or compromise the overall gene expression data distribution. To address these challenges, our primary focus is on effectively utilizing the spatial location information within spatial transcriptomic data to impute missing values, while preserving the overall data distribution. We introduce stMCDI, a masked conditional diffusion model for spatial transcriptomics data imputation, which employs a denoising network trained using randomly masked data portions as guidance, with the unmasked data serving as conditions. Additionally, it utilizes a GNN encoder to integrate the spatial position information, thereby enhancing model performance.

Although considerable research has focused on uncovering the neural correlates of multisensory integration for the modalities of vision, audition, and touch, much less attention has been devoted to understanding interactions between vision and olfaction in humans. In this study, we asked how odors affect neural activity evoked by images of familiar visual objects associated with characteristic smells. We employed scalp-recorded EEG to measure visual ERPs evoked by briefly presented pictures of familiar objects, such as an orange, mint leaves, or a rose. During presentation of each visual stimulus, participants inhaled either a matching odor, a nonmatching odor, or plain air. The N1 component of the visual ERP was significantly enhanced for matching odors in women, but not in men. This is consistent with evidence that women are superior in detecting, discriminating, and identifying odors and that they have a higher gray matter concentration in olfactory areas of the OFC. We conclude that early visual processing is influenced by olfactory cues because of associations between odors and the objects that emit them, and that these associations are stronger in women than in men.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_00732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052285","","","","","","","","5 Mar 2015","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Computer modeling studies incorporating the complex rules for LTP induction and the characteristics of expressed potentiation can be used to make such predictions specific. We review ttie types of synaptic plasticity found in the successive stages of the corticohippocampal pathway, and present results indicating that LTP does participate in definably different forms of memory, suggesting a classification of memory types differing somewhat from categories deduced from behavioral studies. Specifically, the results suggest that subtypes of memory operate serially, in an “assembly line” of specialized functions, each of which adds a unique aspect to the processing of memories.

Utilizing a range of sensory inputs, including taste, haptics, and smell, in addition to audiovisual cues, this study aims to understand how different combinations of these stimuli affect the users’ emotional experience. Two immersive virtual experiences have been developed for this purpose. One included a scenario to evoke positive emotions through selectively chosen pleasant multisensory stimuli, validated in a focus group. The other sought the contrary: to trigger negative emotions by integrating selected combinations of unpleasant multisensory stimuli, also validated in the same focus group. Through a comparative analysis, our findings revealed significant differences in emotional responses between the groups exposed to positive and negative stimuli combinations. Results indicated that combinations involving haptics and taste were particularly effective in eliciting intense emotions using positive stimuli, but their impact was less significant with negative stimuli. This investigation suggests that a fully multisensory virtual environment integrating positive stimuli might lead to cognitive overload, reducing overall emotional responses. In contrast, environments with negative stimuli could enhance emotional engagement and be more likely to avoid cognitive overload. These findings have important implications for designing emotionally resonant and compelling virtual reality experiences. This research enhances the understanding of sensory integration in virtual reality and its effects on emotional engagement, offering valuable insights for developing more impactful virtual experiences.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3499858","National Funds through Portuguese funding agency, FCT — Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UIDB/50014/2020); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(grant numbers:PD/BD/150491/2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10753601","Emotional responses;multisensory virtual reality;virtual reality;virtual tourism","Navigation;Virtual environments;User experience;Emotional responses;Haptic interfaces;Complexity theory","","","","136","CCBYNCND","15 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A compound signal of receptor activity on the antenna can be read out in real time with functional neuroimaging, and individual receptor responses to hundreds of odorants are available in a database. Utilizing the fruit fly antenna as chemosensor enables applications ranging from biomarker detection to identification of unknown chemicals in samples. Here, we propose to connect neural response spaces, mapping odorant responses from one fly to another and to database space. A map is defined exactly for reference odorants common to both subject and target space, while the map for the remaining odorants is estimated based on radial basis function interpolation. On a data set with chemically diverse odorants, mapping to another antenna allows identifying unlabelled subject space odorants by the proximity of their mapped position to labelled odorants in target space. Furthermore, mapping from antenna to database space predicts the individual receptor responses significantly better than a random baseline model, suggesting that receptor responses can be inferred from the compound antenna signal given a sufficiently dense net of reference odorants to support the map.","2471-7819","978-1-7281-4617-1","10.1109/BIBE.2019.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8941717","Dorosophila melanogaster;neuroimaging;chemosensor;interpolation;radial basis functions;registration","Antennas;Interpolation;Standards;Databases;Antenna measurements;Imaging;Chemicals","","","","18","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the 2D Arousal-Valence model, we plot EEG and HRV data onto this model to visualize emotion changes caused by external stimuli. Using this proposed method, we conducted joint research with the home and personal care sector to evaluate emotional responses to aroma products, and with the automotive sector to assess drivers' emotional states. These studies demonstrate the value of academic research in guiding the industrial sector, particularly through emotion estimation based on EEG and HRV. Our findings suggest that these technologies offer valuable insights into consumer emotions, which can help improve product design and user experience.

Contemporary studies typically analyze fMRI data by constructing high-order functional connectivity networks (FCNs) due to their strong interpretability. However, these approaches often overlook temporal information, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Temporal information plays a vital role in reflecting changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent signals. To address this shortcoming, we have devised a framework for extracting temporal dependencies from fMRI data and inferring high-order functional connectivity among regions of interest (ROIs). Our approach postulates that the current state can be determined by the FCN and the state at the previous time, effectively capturing temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance FCN by incorporating high-order features through hypergraph-based manifold regularization. Our algorithm involves causal modeling of the dynamic brain system, and the obtained directed FC reveals differences in the flow of information under different patterns. We have validated the significance of integrating temporal information into FCN using four real-world fMRI datasets. On average, our framework achieves 12% higher accuracy than non-temporal hypergraph-based and low-order FCNs, all while maintaining a short processing time. Notably, our framework successfully identifies the most discriminative ROIs, aligning with previous research, and thereby facilitating cognitive and behavioral studies.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2024.3412399","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62206205); Young Talent Fund of the Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China(grant numbers:20230129); Guangdong High-Level Innovation Research Institution Project(grant numbers:2021B0909050008); Guangzhou Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:202206030003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10553342","Functional MRI;functional connectivity network;temporal information;hypergraph","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Data mining;Laplace equations;Heuristic algorithms;Task analysis","Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Humans;Brain;Algorithms;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Brain Mapping","","","59","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Idiopathic hyposmia (IH), a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is a preclinical marker for the pathology and affects >95% of PD patients. In this paper, SensHand V1 and SensFoot V2, two inertial wearable sensors for upper and lower limbs, were developed to acquire motion data in ten tasks of the MDS-UPDRS III. Fifteen healthy subjects of control, 15 IH people, and 15 PD patients were enrolled. Seventy-one parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis, and the most significant were selected to distinguish among the different classes. Performances of supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) were compared on two-group and three-group classification and considering upper and lower limbs separately or together as a full system. Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (accuracy 1.00 for RF, and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including IH subjects (0.92 F-measure with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, the best performances were obtained using the full system with an RF classifier. The system is, thus, suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, people at risk for PD can be appropriately analyzed, and subtle changes in motor performance that characterize the prodromal phase and the early PD onset can be identified.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856804","","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Task analysis;Support vector machines;Olfactory;Protocols;Wearable sensors","Algorithms;Humans;Olfaction Disorders;Parkinson Disease;Support Vector Machine;Wearable Electronic Devices","3","","22","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on manual extraction features and PCA extraction features, KNN, decision trees, and naive Bayes algorithms are used to construct odor prediction models and compare recognition rates. The experimental results show that the establishment of an odor recognition model based on the structural characteristics of molecules can realize the prediction of unknown odor types, and the odor recognition rate of the model based on the PCA extraction feature combined with the decision tree algorithm is higher. The method is simple and stable, overcomes the complicated process of manually extracting features and the non-universality of features, and improves the accuracy of odor recognition.

Previously-investigated strategies for introducing drugs into the brain have included disruption of the BBB through energy deposition (RF, ultrasound), and diffusion from brain injections (along nonvascular routes) directly into the brain parenchyma. Magnetic gradients can increase transport rates of nanoparticle ferrofluids. As an example, we and others have shown significant increases in transport of drug-coated magnetic nanoparticles across the round window membrane [1]. Transport of chemicals across the cribiform plate (that separates the nasal cavity from the intracranial compartment) and into the brain is used naturally for olfaction, and by drug users (both legal and illicit). In pilot animal studies, we have shown that transport of magnetic nanoparticles can be dramatically increased across the cribiform plate into the brain olfactory bulb, through the application of magnetic gradients on the order of 0.5 T/cm. The increased concentrations of nanoparticles were easily detected with 4.7 T MRI systems. Transport of ferrofluid was observed from the posterior brain to the olfactory bulb under the influence of similar gradients. Such high magnetic gradients could be implemented through custom coils to effect MRI guidance, with minimal bioeffects if ramped up quickly [2]. These levels of gradients are easily realized in either a classic pull magnet configuration or with a Halbach push magnet array, with the push conferring additional flexibility as compared to standard approaches [3]. Additional studies are underway to exploit the use of drug-coated magnetic nanoparticles to gain entry in the central nervous system via natural entry-ways. Potential applications include delivery of drugs for the amelioration of epilepsy, motor and behavior/addictive disorders and to combat infectious diseases.","1082-3654","978-1-4673-2030-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2012.6551857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6551857","","","","5","","11","IEEE","8 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These are all accomplished with an ultrasound-driven air stream serving as an airborne carrier of fragrant substances. The flow originates from a point in midair located away from the ultrasound source and travels while accelerating and maintaining its narrow cross-sectional area. These properties differentiate the flow from conventional jet- or fan-driven flows and contribute to achieving a midair flow. In our system, we employed a phased array of ultrasound transducers so that the traveling direction of the flow could be electronically and instantaneously controlled.

A recent study published in 2022 by Nik Dennler has reported the discovery of the drift effect of a public dataset due to incorrect experimental design. they reported that the order of gas collection was not randomized and further discovered that a select set of gases were collected over a particular period. This paper expands the previous paper, by analyzing the drift effect with low signal, zero-offset subtracted signal’s mean, and standard deviation value by location and time, and examining it with TSNE, a dimensional reduction method. In addition, the accuracy by time and location was analyzed by applying it to various Deep Learning methods. According to the results, we confirmed that gas information is already classified before the gas leaks in terms of temporal and spatial domain. Therefore, the classification accuracy overestimates the actual accuracy that can be obtained due to the drift effect.

However, there are many problems for diagnosing ASD because it requires a lot of preparations and it takes a long time to diagnose. In late years, researches have been focused on the olfaction of patients with ASD. In these researches, there are some significant differences in the detection ability between the children with ASD and control groups. To provide another determination from characteristics of ASD using olfaction, we conducted examinations of visual effect on the odor identification ability for the children with ASD and non-ASD. The experimental results show that children with ASD are more likely to mistake the odor identification than non-ASD when an odor was presented with a video.

The deployed searcher can be a single mobile searcher, multiple cooperating mobile searchers, or a stationary Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that localizes the source via distributed cooperation strategies. The use of multiple searchers can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the search, but it is also more costly. In this paper, we study the effect of assisting a single mobile searcher with a WSN that is distributed around the environment. Utilizing the Infotaxis searching strategy, two algorithms are proposed to facilitate the cooperation between the searcher and the WSN nodes.

Three navigation algorithms are compared both with a simple gas sensor and with an electronic nose. Their performance in finding an ethanol source in a room with obstacles is evaluated. The first navigation strategy is based on bacterial chemotaxis. The second strategy is based in the silk-worm moth algorithm to search and track a female moth pheromone plume. The last strategy is based on odour map estimation and maximum concentration following. The electronic nose utilized is composed by an array of different and weakly selective metal oxide gas sensors.

Two current dipoles in each hemisphere of the brain are supposed as a source model. To investigate the ability of this method, source localization in simulation was performed by the presented method. As a result, if the noise level is restricted under 2 percent (S/N/spl ap/20), the source localization of the simulation was obtained with the error less than 1 cm.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.717695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=717695","","Genetic algorithms;Brain modeling;Coils;Olfactory;Magnetic field measurement;SQUIDs;Magnetic fields;Laboratories;Density measurement;Magnetic flux density","","12","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to previously reported studies. our results showed that olfaction actually had a negative impact on information recall. We believe that this difference is due to the ambiental nature of olfaction in previous work, whereas in our study we used directed olfactory stimuli.","1945-788X","978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202658","","Olfactory","","11","","11","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
