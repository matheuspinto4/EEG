Since sadness has an influence on the mind, it can be hard for the patient to tell the doctor about their situation. Typically utilized diagnostic tools include questionnaires or interview-style evaluations of the symptoms, and also using laboratory tests to see if the depressive symptoms coexist with other severe diseases. In recent years, a variety of approaches have been created to aid the diagnosis of depression, thanks to the development using convolutional neural networks with machine learning. Being a multifactorial condition, depression should be diagnosed using a multimodal approach for an efficient examination. In order to analyze depression using emotion recognition, a number have been created for both unimodal and multimodal approaches. This study reviews these approaches. When compared to multimodal approaches, which combine one or more features, the unimodal approach takes into account just one attribute from the range of facial expressions, voice, etc. for depression identification. This study also discusses many techniques for detecting depression in speech, including spectral, acoustic, and fisher vector algorithms, as well as approaches for extracting face characteristics from speech. The survey includes the current research on emotion recognition that uses auditory and visual information to identify depression.

Noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) has been shown effective as biomarkers for objective depression diagnose and treatment response prediction, and dry EEG electrodes further extend its availability for clinical use. Even though many efforts have been made to identify depression biomarkers, searching reliable EEG biomarkers for depression detection remains challenging. This work presents a systematic investigation of capabilities of emotion EEG patterns for depression detection using a dry EEG electrode system. We design an emotion elicitation paradigm with happy, neutral and sad emotions and collect EEG signals during film watching from 33 depressed patients and 40 healthy controls. The mean activation levels at frontal and temporal sites in the alpha, beta and gamma bands of the depressed group are different to those of the healthy group, indicating the impacts of depressive symptoms on the emotion experiences. To leverage the topology information among EEG channels for emotion recognition and depression detection, an Attentive Simple Graph Convolutional network is built. The deep depression-health classifier achieves a sensitivity of 81.93% and a specificity of 91.69% on the happy emotions, suggesting the promising use of the emotion neural patterns for distinguishing the depressed patients from the healthy controls.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340623","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340623","","Electrodes;Support vector machines;Systematics;Sensitivity;Biomarkers;Depression;Electroencephalography","Humans;Depression;Quality of Life;Emotions;Electroencephalography;Biomarkers","2","","13","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Like the other mendable disease, depression can be cured completely with proper and proactive diagnosis. The lack of awareness and reluctance to visit a clinical practitioner may make the situation more critical for a patient having depressive disorder. In this paper, we have reviewed available literature on three prime focuses- Eye gaze measuring, EEG and facial emotion recognition. The main aim of this paper is to perform a systematic review of the available literatures in the selected area and explore the trend in this area and try to indicate the future direction also. Around 130 papers from peer-reviewed, High-Impact journals and conferences like Elsevier, IEEE, Springer, Lancet, NCBI, MDPI etc. have been selected and a systematic review has been performed on those papers to determine the trends as well as to indicate the future direction of this research.","","979-8-3503-0448-0","10.1109/IC3I59117.2023.10397718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10397718","Depression;Eye Tracking;Facial Emotion;Gaze point;PRISMA","Emotion recognition;Systematics;Market research;Depression;Electroencephalography;Informatics;Diseases","","","","46","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we design a cross-over experiment protocol comprising of two emotion eliciting environments relaxation and arousal that is presented to the participant either in a 2D monitor or a 3D head-mounted (HMD) VR display. The EEG data is collected during the experiment and analyzed offline to classify emotion elicited by low and high arousal environments using SVM classification of band power features. A 10-fold cross validation is performed and classification accuracy for each subject is computed for 3D-VR and 2D-screen display. The average classification accuracies over subjects are obtained as 66.88% and 59.27% in 3D-VR and 2D-screen group respectively. The performance difference between 3D-VR and 2D screen is statistically significant $(p\lt 0.05)$, indicating that 3D-VR generates more distinct EEG patterns associated with emotion elicitation. Further, significant differences in band powers from alpha, theta and beta bands are also observed between both groups.

In this paper, we design a mobile platform of music therapy based on EEG feedback. The platform can record user's EEG in real time, analyze the emotion state, and choose a suitable music track to play. Users can adjust their emotion at anytime and anywhere. They can examine the therapeutic effects in time by observing EEG feedback on mobile client. In consideration of the hardware and software resources of mobile device limitations, we only collect EEG data from two channels and barely compute beta/alpha power ratio and alpha lateralization as the signal features used to measure test subjects' emotion status.

We include a preprocessing step using FFT that will extract features from the frequency domain to enhance model performance. We also use Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning, as in the number of units in GRU and the learning rate, to get 83% accuracy.

According to the study of World Health Organization (WHO), depression will become the second largest cause of illness threatening the life of human beings in 2020, so early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of depression is very important to save the health and life of human beings. In order to alleviate the damage caused by depression and make early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of depression, a portable and accurate depression detection and diagnosis method is most necessary. Due to the highly complexity, nonlinearity and non-stationarity of electroencephalogram (EEG) data in nature, we present a novel method for pervasive EEG-based detection and diagnosis of depression with the resting state eye-closed EEG data of Fp1, Fpz and Fp2 locations of scalp electrodes, which are closely related to emotion, collected through three-electrode pervasive EEG collection device in this paper. Experiment has been conducted and totally 170 (81 depressive patients and 89 normal subjects) subjects' pervasive EEG data have been collected in resting state and eye-closed. Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized to analyze the pervasive EEG data and the average accuracy reaches 83.07%. After Friedman Test and post-hoc two-tailed Nemenyi Test, we propose a splitting criterion for pervasive EEG. The data analysis experimental results show that the proposed method for detecting and diagnosing depression is effective and convenient, and it also demonstrate that the three-electrode pervasive EEG collection device has broad prospects in depression detection and diagnosis.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217946","depression;early detection;pervasive EEG;Support Vector Machine","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Support vector machines;Entropy;Mental disorders;Feature extraction;Psychology","","46","","45","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the underlying mechanism through which taVNS mimics VNS remains elusive. Moreover, the parameters of taVNS are singularly fixed and open loop in previous work, which is difficult to apply to all users as individual differences are inevitable. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the important biomarkers of neural activity, this study aims to develop a closed-loop system for personalized interventions in emotion regulation by integrating taVNS with EEG feedback. We first design a taVNS system based on EEG signal feedback and verify the performance metrics of the system. Second, we design experimental paradigms to explore the changes in EEG features under the taVNS. The experimental results show that the EEG characteristics differ between different taVNS frequencies (between 50 and 100 Hz). Moreover, we observe substantial distinctions between EEG characteristics during the taVNS state and the resting state, with pre-taVNS, taVNS, and post-taVNS exhibiting notable differences. Specifically, the power spectral density (PSD) in the taVNS state is lower than in the resting state ( ${p} \lt {0.05}$ ), except for the beta band where the opposite trend is observed. Additionally, features such as Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and Reyi entropy (REn) displayed a decreasing trend throughout the taVNS ( ${p} \lt {0.05}$ ). Furthermore, we employ hidden Markov models (HMMs) to reveal the heterogeneity of dynamic changes in the brain during taVNS, providing a mechanistic interpretation of taVNS.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3441619","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC3500501); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China with the Science and Technology Innovation 2030 (STI2030)-Major Projects(grant numbers:2021ZD0200601); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M730250); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:6227807,62402041); Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) Research and Innovation Promoting Project(grant numbers:2022YCXZ012); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:7244491); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10659348","Electroencephalogram (EEG);hidden Markov models (HMMs);power spectral density (PSD);transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)","Electroencephalography;Sensors;Depression;Circuits;Hidden Markov models;Acupuncture;Systematics","","3","","73","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We designed an efficient acquisition protocol to acquire the EEG and psychophysiological signals under pictures induction environment (calm-neutral and negative-excited) for participants. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of psychophysiological signals have been tried to select suitable segments of EEG signal for improving efficiency and performance of emotional stress recognition system. After pre-processing the signals, both Linear and nonlinear features were employed to extract the EEG parameters. Wavelet coefficients and chaotic invariants like fractal dimension by Higuchi's algorithm and correlation dimension were used to extract the characteristics of the EEG signal which showed that the classification accuracy in two emotional states was 82.7% using the Elman classifier.

To address these issues rapidly and automatically, this paper proposes a new framework, Two-tracks depression diagnosis(TDD), which only requires subjects to watch 60 seconds of emotion-induced material. The framework can extract linear and nonlinear features from Electro-EncephaloGram(EEG) signals for identifying depression. At the same time, it effectively extracts the subjects' emotional features as cues for identifying depression under the guidance of the emotion-induced paradigm. The accuracy of this method in a normal environment can reach 89.03%. The robustness of TDD is obviously better when using cross-individual physiological signals to train the model. Under the condition of using all subjects, the accuracy of TDD is 11.71% higher than that of the model using only physiological signal features. TDD is completely based on objective physiological signals for depression detection, which are difficult to be manipulated subjectively. Therefore, this method can eliminate subjective interference and make the results more realistic and objective than scale detection.","","978-1-6654-6353-9","10.1109/FCSIT57414.2022.00041","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672262); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097845","TDD;Emotion-induced;Depression;EEG;physical signals","Mental health;Medical services;Interference;Watches;Depression;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","","","14","IEEE","14 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Another technique that is very useful and common, i.e., EEG, is mostly used to do such data analysis. EEG plays a very important role in detecting and correcting brain illness. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using small metal electrodes attached to the scalp. This activity results in wave lines of EEG signals. Here, we used a combination of the K-means algorithm and SVM-supervised machine learning algorithm to analyze the EEG data. K-means algorithm is used to divide and attempt to cluster the data while the SVM algorithm is used to classify the stress level based on these clusters. The main objective of this model is to improve the accuracy of stress detection by using the strength of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

We experimentally compared our methods with the existing five emotion recognition methods in practical application. The results show that our methods can outperform the existing five methods and obtain an emotion recognition accuracy higher than 80% in detection of anger, depression, doubt, and indignation.

Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective.

Conversely, the method under this study employed machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forests and Deep Neural Networks, to analyze multi-modal data including facial expressions, vocal tones, and physiological signals of 200 samples from ADHD and ASD patients. The Random Forest model was 92 % accurate in classification compared to existing methods, and the Deep Neural Networks further improved detection of subtle variations in emotions and proved to be a more robust and reliable method for distinguishing the patterns of emotional recognition between both groups.

Good music can have a positive effect on mood, allowing human listeners to reduce anxiety, increase mental energy and motivation, and is believed to have analgesic and anxiolytic properties. The various physiological and psychological effects of music therapy on humans have been reported in the literature, and the effects of music on physiology and behavior have been studied in animals. Many studies have concluded that animals are also affected by music. Both the rhythmic and spectral distributions of music can convey emotional meaning, and these features have been shown in altering the behavior of animals. In this paper, we first constructed an emotion recognition model for cats based on multi-channel physiological signals, selecting EEG, ECG, and respiratory signals that are closely related to emotions, and utilizing the representational complementarity between multiple signals to construct a feature-level fusion emotion recognition model, which can effectively recognize a variety of emotions in cats. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of recognition has been effectively improved. Second, a music classification recognition network based on LSTM network was designed so as to obtain the most effective music styles and attributes that enhance the cat's emotions and help the cat alleviate negative emotions. The network shares the interpretation layer of classification on the basis of LSTM network, which can greatly reduce the learning of model parameters and improve the learning efficiency.","","979-8-3503-0702-3","10.1109/ISPCEM60569.2023.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499373","Medical Data Enhancement;Improved WGAN Network;Multi-Channel Fusion CNN;Gastric Cancer Detection","Emotion recognition;Animals;Mood;Music;Electrocardiography;Signal processing;Brain modeling","","1","","14","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apart from the obvious usage for industry applications in human-robot interaction, acquiring the emotional state of a person automatically also is of great potential for the health domain, especially in psychology and psychiatry. Here, evaluation of human emotion is often done using oral feedback or questionnaires during doctor-patient sessions. However, this can be perceived as intrusive by the patient. Furthermore, the evaluation can only be done in a noncontinuous manner, e.g. once a week during therapy sessions. In contrast, using automatic emotion detection, the affect state of a person can be evaluated in a continuous non-intrusive manner, for example to detect early on-sets of depression. An additional benefit of automatic emotion recognition is the objectivity of such an approach, which is not influenced by the perception of the patient and the doctor. To reach the goal of objectivity, it is important, that the source of the emotion is not easily manipulable, e.g. as in the speech modality. To circumvent this caveat, novel approaches in emotion detection research the potential of using physiological measures, such as galvanic skin sensors or pulse meters. In this paper we outline a way of detecting emotion from brain waves, i.e., EEG data. While EEG allows for a continuous, real-time automatic emotion recognition, it furthermore has the charm of measuring the affect close to the point of emergence: the brain. Using EEG data for emotion detection is nevertheless a challenging task: Which features, EEG channel locations and frequency bands are best suited for is an issue of ongoing research.

The capability of human beings to present different expressions clashes with the emotional state of mind. Therefore, it is challenging to identify a human’s real emotional state by observing physical appearance. Nowadays, using emotional engineering to predict human emotions is one of the major attempts of Machine Learning (ML). This study aims to investigate the usage of techniques of machine learning for efficient emotion prediction that relies on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG dataset is complex and sometimes noisy, making it difficult to interpret using traditional methods. So, in this research the Kaggle dataset collected through a Muse headband, five distinct ML methods are applied to classify emotions. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, support, and accuracy are employed to differentiate between different classification techniques. Random Forest turned out to be the best method due to its high accuracy 99%. Three emotions are predicted based on the results of performance metrics. This study benefits mental health monitoring, neurofeedback therapy, stress management, human-computer interaction, etc. This study lays the groundwork for exploring this field and helps develop more sophisticated control systems in the future.","","979-8-3315-2924-6","10.1109/ICISCN64258.2025.10934662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10934662","EEG;BCI;Emotion detection;classification;LR;DT;RF;SVM;and KNN","Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Accuracy;Nearest neighbor methods;Electroencephalography;Object recognition;Noise measurement;Random forests;Neurofeedback;Monitoring","","","","21","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ASD can be detected by observing distinct patterns in an individual's learning, behaviour, communication, decision making ability and social interactions. The ability to anticipate emotions can prove beneficial in various situations, particularly when dealing with individuals across the autism spectrum with varying degrees of severity. Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading. Similar methods are used now to assist those who are autistic.

Fragrance diffusers have been used as the potential appliance to reconcile mental conditions and achieve stress relief in daily life. Although perceiving fragrances are a complicated and subjective experience, studies have shown that it is possible to reveal the personal preference of fragrance from brain activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, using EEG to detect neural/mental states and apply them to human-machine interfaces has also been investigated for years. Therefore, this pilot study has two aims: (1) to identify users’ preference for fragrances from EEG; (2) to develop a personalized fragrance diffuser, Aroma Box, which can detect three mental states from EEG when a user feels depressed, stressed, or drowsily and then release fragrances in real-time to help user recover from the abnormal states. To achieve this goal, we first extracted the features and built a classifier to identify the user’s preference for fragrances from EEG. Then we calculated the indicators of brain states based on the EEG frequency analysis. Based on our preliminary experimental results, we deployed our algorithms in an in-house developed diffuser with a consumer 32-channel EEG headset, which has been further implemented in a real-life working environment and evaluated its efficacy by two users.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582446","National Cheng Kung University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582446","Olfactory perception;EEG;fragrance diffuser;brain-computer interface;human-computer interaction","Headphones;Electric potential;Conferences;Olfactory;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Regulation","","1","","26","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It makes the patient's emotion adjust to the normal state by generating a simulated environment in a VR system to comfort the subject and relieve subject mental stress. This paper presents a novel VR relaxation scenes design and evaluation framework where subject sensitive tourism VR videos were selected and combined with alpha wave induced background music. The relaxation effectiveness of VR scenes were evaluated by SAM scale, relaxation questionnaire and frontal EEG signals. A number of frontal EEG features from various analysis domains were explored to obtain the best stress-relevant features and to establish a stress-frontal EEG correlation model for stress evaluation, including time, frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc. 13 students aged between 20 and 30 were recruited in the evaluation experiment of 6 newly designed VR relaxation scenes. During which subjects frontal EEG signals were recorded as well as the SAM scale and questionnaire, the features that demonstrate an significant difference before and after watching VR scenes were identified, such as Energy, Energy ratio, the mean square root of frequency, frequency domain symmetry, Energy entropy and Shannon entropywhere frequency bands of delta, theta, low alpha and high alpha were considered. Finally, the features that demonstrate an significant difference before and after watching VR scenes were identified.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPS) provide a temporally-sensitive biological index of attention to competing visual stimuli at the level of neuronal populations in the visual cortex. SSVEPS can potentially be used to quantify whether affective distractors vs. task-relevant stimuli have “won” the competition for attention at a trial-by-trial level during neuro-feedback sessions. This study piloted a protocol for a SSVEP-based neurofeedback training to modify affect-biased attention using a portable augmented-reality (AR) EEG interface. During neurofeedback sessions with five healthy participants, signifi-cantly greater attention was given to the task-relevant stimulus (a Gabor patch) than to affective distractors (negative emotional expressions) across SSVEP indices (p<0.000l). SSVEP indices exhibited excellent internal consistency as evidenced by a maximum Guttman split-half coefficient of 0.97 when comparing even to odd trials.

The rapid advancement of technology can be used to enhance therapeutic approaches. The current and popular detection approaches are insufficiently tailored, relying mostly on professional expertise and knowledge. Previously conducted experiments, such as those based solely on speech, facial expressions, and other indicators, can be affected by the respondents' current state or mood. Others, such as EEG, have access and equipment concerns. The methodology proposed uses an ensemble of inputs, consisting of the user's speech and text, to predict the severity of depression. When these inputs are provided via a chatbot, the user is more likely to respond honestly. The audio samples in the AVEC dataset are labeled with the PHQ-8 score and a binary representation of depressed or not depressed. Spectral features are extracted from these samples and are passed as arrays through neural network models. A transformer-based machine learning model is used to classify text-based responses into one of five emotions: sadness, rage, joy, fear, and neutral. Speech and text classification accuracies were calculated, and their scores were finally aggregated. Since many do not seek help due to socio-economic barriers, the proposed method can readily be integrated into a virtual platform to overcome such obstacles. We believe that this method can serve as a radical approach to detecting depression. It would serve as a platform for level-one screening, enabling individuals to gauge the severity of their condition from the safety of a screen.","","978-1-6654-2168-3","10.1109/I2CT54291.2022.9825306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825306","Mental Health;Depression;PHQ8;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Machine Learning;Random Forest;Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC);BERT;Artificial Intelligence;Natural Language Processing (NLP)","Mood;Neural networks;Text categorization;Mental health;Machine learning;Depression;Feature extraction","","1","","14","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Emotion affects blood pressure, heart rate, kidney function, and a few disorders of the nervous system. Parkinson's disease, which causes impairment of movement, is one of the brain disorders. This issue is caused by a reduction in dopamine release in the cortex of the brain. Dopamine production deviations have been related to essential hypertension. Dopamine has a crucial role in anxiety modulation in multiple regions of the brain. Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently indicate that acute stress worsens their motor symptoms, especially gait freezing, dyskinesia, and tremors and the emotions play a substantial role in Parkinson's disease. This study focuses on the Classification Learner algorithms and the Electro Encephalogram (EEG) dataset, both of which covered the diagnostic range of PD development.

Research indicates that timely diagnosis and intervention are vital in treating various mental disorders. However, the early somatization symptoms of certain mental disorders may not be immediately evident, often resulting in their oversight and misdiagnosis. Additionally, the traditional diagnosis methods incur high time and cost. Deep learning methods based on fMRI and EEG have improved the efficiency of the mental disorder detection process. However, the cost of the equipment and trained staff are generally huge. Moreover, most systems are only trained for a specific mental disorder and are not general-purpose. Recently, physiological studies have shown that there are some speech and facial-related symptoms in a few mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD). In this paper, we focus on the emotional expression features of mental disorders and introduce a multimodal mental disorder diagnosis system based on audio-visual information input. Our proposed system is based on spatial-temporal attention networks and innovative uses a less computationally intensive pre-train audio recognition network to fine-tune the video recognition module for better results.

However, the manual analysis of the EEG signal is very complex, time-consuming, and depends on the expertise and experience of the users. Hence, nowadays research is conducted on automated EEG signal analysis using artificial intelligence and computer-aided technologies. This would allow fast and highly accurate results. The goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the EEG signal analysis using deep learning (DL).Methods: This systematic literature review of EEG processing using Deep Learning (DL) was achieved on Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, resulting in 403 identified papers. All collected studies were analyzed based on main disorders studied, type of tasks performed, data source, stages of analysis, and DL architecture.Results: DL in EEG processing is promising in various research applications. It covered the common neurological disorders diagnosis such as epilepsy, movement disorder, depression, schizophrenia, autism, alcohol use, attention, memory, sleep, pain, etc. The main tasks covered by the included studies are detection and classification. The average range of data sources utilized by the included studies is 127 subjects with an EEG recording a total duration of 458 hours. In fact, we identified the use of a plethora of DL architecture for EEG analysis. 57% of papers used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whereas Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were the architecture choice of about 12% of papers. Combinations of CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were used in 13% of studies. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Autoencoder (AEs) were used in 5% and 4% of papers respectively. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and other hybrid architectures appeared in 1% of studies.Conclusion: This systematic review showed that DL is a powerful tool to process, analyze, and interpret EEG data without requiring extraction steps. These intelligent models can allow self-learning from the training data. On the other hand, DL models need a lot of data to learn, while suffering from a lack of confidence due to their black-box nature. Hence, studies on transfer learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could help in solving such issues. Big Data, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and closed-loop technology can also help DL-based systems in achieving fast, and accurate processing of EEG recordings.","","978-1-6654-4238-1","10.1109/ICDS53782.2021.9626707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9626707","Deep learning;Electroencephalography;EEG;Machine Learning;Systematic Literature Review","Deep learning;Systematics;Computational modeling;Bibliographies;Computer architecture;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","21","","48","IEEE","1 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses the problem that affective computing is difficult to be put into real-world practical fields intuitively, such as emotion disease diagnosis and so on, due to the non-intuitive data representation. In view of the fact that people's ability to understand two-dimensional images is much higher than that of one-dimensional data, we use Markov Transition Fields to visualize time series signals. MTF images represent the first order Markov transition probability along one dimension and temporal dependency along the other. Besides, with the limitation of experimental equipment and individual differences among volunteers, noise is inevitable. We apply AC-GAN to remove noisy pixels within high dimension and acquire high resolution images before making classification. Then we use Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks on 2 real world datasets to learn high-level features from MTF images. The classification results of our approach are competitive with the state-of-the-art approach. This method makes the visualization based emotion recognition become possible, which is beneficial for the application of cognitive robots or in the medical fields, such as depression and other psychological problems diagnosis, and can help doctors and patients understand the condition more intuitively.","","978-1-5386-3360-1","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482097","Emotion Recognition;EEG;Markov Transition Fields;AC-GAN;Tiled CNN","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Time series analysis;Markov processes;Task analysis;Speech recognition;Training","","3","","37","IEEE","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a comparative analysis between a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and a Fuzzy C-Means classifier to differentiate ex-combatant subjects from civilian controls using graph-based functional connectivity networks calculated from scalp EEG recordings. EEG data were acquired while participants performed an adaptation of a Dual Valence Task, a well-known experimental task commonly used to analyze emotional processing. We obtained up to 80%of accuracy with both proposed algorithms. These results are comparable with other approaches reported in the literature. Together with conductual tasks, the computarized techniques proposed in this paper provide a decision support system to psychologists for determining the level of exposure to the conflict of the ex-combatants, and consequently a tool for their posterior treatment.","","978-1-5090-5105-2","10.1109/LA-CCI.2016.7885706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885706","Artificial Neural Networks;Ex-combatants;Functional Connectivity;Fuzzy Clustering;Graph Theory;Scalp EEG","Standards;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Electrodes;Scalp;Correlation","","","","21","IEEE","27 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Role of EEG-Based Emotional Feedback in Enhancing the Effectiveness of Tai Chi Sports Programs for Oral Health Promotion","S. Wei","College of Physical Education and Health Science, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China",IEEE Access,"13 May 2025","2025","13","","81063","81082","The integration of advanced emotion-driven feedback mechanisms, such as EEG-based emotional analysis, represents an innovative approach to enhancing the effectiveness of Tai Chi sports programs tailored for oral health promotion. Traditional oral health strategies, which often rely on educational campaigns and routine reinforcement of hygiene practices, have demonstrated short-term improvements in knowledge and awareness but struggle to sustain long-term behavioral changes, particularly among populations with low health literacy or motivational barriers. These conventional methods lack personalization and dynamic interaction, limiting their ability to engage diverse populations effectively. To address these shortcomings, our framework bridges the gap between conventional approaches and modern neurofeedback methodologies by integrating EEG-based emotional feedback into Tai Chi sports programs. Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, is recognized for its ability to promote both physical and mental well-being through controlled movement, breath regulation, and cognitive focus. The incorporation of real-time emotional monitoring within Tai Chi sessions allows for dynamic adaptation of training content based on participants’ emotional states, fostering deeper engagement, improved stress regulation, and sustained commitment to positive oral health practices. Additionally, the inclusion of gamified elements and culturally relevant adaptations within Tai Chi practice further enhances user interaction, creating a behaviorally sensitive framework that maximizes long-term adherence and effectiveness in diverse communities. This novel approach leverages the holistic benefits of Tai Chi alongside cutting-edge neurofeedback techniques, offering a transformative pathway for enhancing oral health promotion through sports-based interventions.mework that maximizes long-term adherence and effectiveness in diverse communities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3561179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10965650","EEG-based emotional feedback;oral health promotion;Tai Chi sports programs;behavioral modeling;public health intervention","Sports;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Adaptation models;Emotional responses;Deep learning;Regulation;Feature extraction;Dentistry","","","","50","CCBY","15 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fast-paced and busy lifestyles, noisy nightlife, and other various social parameters have resulted in increased disturbance during sleeping. In addition to external causes, a stressed-out mind is a source of anxiety or excitement that can lead to sleep disturbances. The aim of this research is to propose an interactive robotic system companion which could be used in the treatment of insomnia by providing various interactive services to the user. In addition to direct communication, the robot employs a variety of environmental and physiological sensors to receive feedback from a user and observe performance. One of the key modules of this system is the use of electroencephalography for monitoring sleep quality. We use an interaction design approach based on simplicity and approachability. Speech Recognition and Human-Computer Interaction are the two major parts of this research. The robot's audio channel uses Speech Recognition to communicate with the user, mostly via conversation because other forms of direct communication are not convenient for this scenario. The Human-Computer Interaction aspect includes playing suitable music (including white noise) and spraying essential oils according to different instructions. In addition to establishing multimodal interactive connection with the user, the system also provides entertainment services. The aim is for this proposed robot to act as a personal companion for people with insomnia and improve their quality of sleeping.","","978-1-5386-9269-1","10.1109/AIVR.2018.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8613668","Social Robot, insomnia treatment, human-computer interaction, EEG","Sleep;Electroencephalography;Robot sensing systems;Speech recognition;Biomedical monitoring","","4","","21","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The theory of human touch that causes the body to release hormone oxytocin to effectively alleviate anxiety shed light on a potential alternative to assist existing methods. Wearable robots that generate affective touch have the potential to improve social bonds and regulate emotion and cognitive functions. In this study, we used a wearable robotic tactile stimulation device, AffectNodes2, to mimic human affective touch. The touch-stimulated brain waves were captured from 4 EEG electrodes placed on the parietal, prefrontal and left and right temporal lobe regions of the brain. The novel Deep MSCNN with emotion polling structure had been developed to extract Affective touch, Non-affective touch and Relaxation stimuli with over 95% accuracy, which allows the robot to grasp the current human affective status.

One that benefited greatly from this development is healthcare. Due to the independence from wires and other specific hardware equipment, these small devices were included in medical equipment with the end goal of aiding specialists in obtaining complete information in a shorter period of time. This led to a decrease in diagnosis time and in an improved success rate for different operations. Desired continuous mobility and poor time management are key factors that led to various brain diseases and not only. To keep pace with this trend, many solutions have been developed over time to counteract this trend and improve the quality of life. Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors have the role to study the activity of the brain in various states and provide measurements that can aid patients and specialists in dealing with certain issues. This paper has the objective to present different use cases in which EEG sensors can be used to detect, diagnose or treat different disorders. Moreover, we have conducted a survey of existing hardware and software solutions that can be integrated with medical sensing hardware.
