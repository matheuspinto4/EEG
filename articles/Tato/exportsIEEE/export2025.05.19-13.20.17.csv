When part of the body is stimulated by tactile vibration at a particular frequency, a periodic electrophysiological brain response is elicited in the EEG activity. This response, called the steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs), has the same frequency components as the driving tactile stimulus and sometimes also higher harmonics. In this study, based on the characteristics of magnetic steel, we developed a somatosensory tactile actuator which could generate the constant low-frequency stimulus. And in order to verify the optimal resonance frequency of human's tactile system, vibro-tactile stimulations of different frequencies were carried out to different subjects' right index fingers. The experiment results showed that the largest response amplitudes are typically observed for stimulation frequencies near 21 Hz.","","978-1-4673-9104-7","10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279795","Steady-state Somatosensory Evoked Ppotentials (SSSEPs);Stimulation;Tactile Vibration;Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Resonant frequency;Vibrations;Fingers;Steady-state;Indexes;Electroencephalography;Steel","","3","","22","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Not only that, but it is also one of the most important senses that are indispensable. However, compared to sight and hearing, it is often neglected. In particular, since humans use the tactile sense of the skin to recognize and manipulate objects, without tactile sensation, it is very difficult to recognize or skillfully manipulate objects. In addition, the importance and interest of haptic technology related to touch are increasing with the development of technologies such as VR and AR in recent years. So far, the focus is only on haptic technology based on mechanical devices. Especially, there are not many studies on tactile sensation in the field of brain-computer interface based on EEG. There have been some studies that measured the surface roughness of artificial structures in relation to EEG-based tactile sensation. However, most studies have used passive contact methods in which the object moves, while the human subject remains still. Additionally, there have been no EEG-based tactile studies of active skin touch. In reality, we directly move our hands to feel the sense of touch. Therefore, as a preliminary study for our future research, we collected EEG signals for tactile sensation upon skin touch based on active touch and compared and analyzed differences in brain changes during touch and movement tasks. Through time-frequency analysis and statistical analysis, significant differences in power changes in alpha, beta, gamma, and high-gamma regions were observed. In addition, major spatial differences were observed in the sensory-motor region of the brain.","2572-7672","978-1-6654-1337-4","10.1109/BCI53720.2022.9734979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734979","brain-computer interface;electroencephalography;neurohaptics;tactile;touch;active touch;skin","Time-frequency analysis;Statistical analysis;Auditory system;Skin;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Surface roughness","","4","","30","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue has being coined “BCI-Illiteracy” and is observed among different BCI modalities. Here, we compare the performance and the BCI-illiteracy rate of a tactile selective sensation (SS) and motor imagery (MI) BCI, for a large subject samples. We analyzed 80 experimental sessions from 57 subjects with two-class SS protocols. For SS, the group average performance was 79.8 ± 10.6%, with 43 out of the 57 subjects (75.4%) exceeding the 70% BCI-illiteracy threshold for left- and right-hand SS discrimination. When compared with previous results, this tactile BCI outperformed all other tactile BCIs currently available. We also analyzed 63 experimental sessions from 43 subjects with two-class MI BCI protocols, where the group average performance was 77.2 ± 13.3%, with 69.7% of the subjects exceeding the 70% performance threshold for left- and right-hand MI. For within-subject comparison, the 24 subjects who participated to both the SS and MI experiments, the BCI performance was superior with SS than MI especially in beta frequency band (p <; 0.05), with enhanced R2 discriminative information in the somatosensory cortex for the SS modality. Both SS and MI showed a functional dissociation between lower alpha ([8 10] Hz) and upper alpha ([10 13] Hz) bands, with BCI performance significantly better in the upper alpha than the lower alpha (p <; 0.05) band. In summary, we demonstrated that SS is a promising BCI modality with low BCI illiteracy issue and has great potential in practical applications reaching large population.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2769686","University Starter Grant of the University of Waterloo(grant numbers:203859); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51620105002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094983","Tactile BCI;selective sensation;BCI-illiteracy;motor imagery;somatosensory BCI","Electroencephalography;Protocols;Vibrations;Visualization;Wrist;Steady-state","Adult;Alpha Rhythm;Beta Rhythm;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Functional Laterality;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Imagination;Male;Movement;Psychomotor Performance;Somatosensory Cortex;Touch;Young Adult","14","","65","IEEE","3 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: Based on the similarity between tactile induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) and imagined sensation induced ERD activation, we extensively evaluated BCI performance when using a conventional and a novel calibration strategy. In the conventional calibration, the tactile imagined data was used, while in the sensory calibration model sensory stimulation data was used. Subjects were required to sense the tactile stimulus when real tactile was applied to the left or right wrist and were required to perform imagined sensation tasks in the somatosensory BCI paradigm. Results: The sensory calibration led to a significantly better performance than the conventional calibration when tested on the same imagined sensation dataset ( $\text{F}_{(1,19)}$ =10.89, P=0.0038), with an average 5.1% improvement in accuracy. Moreover, the sensory calibration was 39.3% faster in reaching a performance level of above 70% accuracy. Conclusion: The proposed approach of using tactile ERD from the sensory cortex provides an effective way of reducing the calibration time in a somatosensory BCI system. Significance: The tactile stimulation would be specifically useful before BCI usage, avoiding excessive fatigue when the mental task is difficult to perform. The tactile ERD approach may find BCI applications for patients or users with preserved afferent pathways.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3184402","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0701400); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2022C03011); Chuanqi Research and Development Center of Zhejiang University; Starry Night Science Fund of Zhejiang University Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study(grant numbers:SN-ZJU-SIAS-002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Project for Hangzhou Medical Disciplines of Excellence; Key Project for Hangzhou Medical Disciplines; Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration(grant numbers:MSV202115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810279","Brain-computer interface (BCI);tactile event-related desynchronization (ERD);somatosensory BCI;imagined sensation","Task analysis;Calibration;Electroencephalography;Wrist;Brain modeling;Vibrations;Time-frequency analysis","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Touch","13","","77","CCBY","29 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, given that the somatosensory cortex areas, each of which correspond to a different body part, are well clustered, we can assume that the spatial information could be beneficial for SSSEP analysis. Based on this assumption, we apply the common spatial pattern (CSP) method, which is the spatial feature extraction method most widely used for the motor imagery BCI paradigm, to SSSEP BCI.

During an imagined tactile sensation, referred to as somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO), the subject shifts and maintains somatosensory attention on a body part, e.g., left or right hand. The SAO can be detected from EEG recordings for establishing a communication channel. To test for the hypothesis that SAO on different body parts can be discriminated from EEG, 14 subjects were assigned to a group who received an actual sensory stimulation (STE-Group), and 18 subjects were assigned to the SAO only group (SAO-Group). In single trials, the STE-Group received tactile stimulation first (both wrists simultaneously stimulated), and then maintained the attention on the selected body part (without stimulation). The same group also performed the SAO task first and then received the tactile stimulation. Conversely, the SAO-Group performed SAO without any stimulation, neither before nor after the SAO. In both the STE-Group and SAO-Group, it was possible to identify the SAO-related oscillatory activation that corresponded to a contralateral event-related desynchronization (ERD) stronger than the ipsilateral ERD. Discriminative information, represented as R2, was found mainly on the somatosensory area of the cortex. In the STE-Group, the average classification accuracy of SAO was 83.6%, and it was comparable with tactile BCI based on selective sensation (paired-t test, P > 0.05). In the SAO-Group the average online performance was 75.7%. For this group, after frequency band selection the offline performance reached 82.5% on average, with 80% for 12 subjects and ≥95% for four subjects. Complementary to tactile sensation, the SAO does not require sensory stimulation, with the advantage of being completely independent from the stimulus.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2572226","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China(grant numbers:2011CB013305); Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration(grant numbers:MSV201607); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51375296); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478120","Brain–computer interface (BCI);imagined sensation;selective sensation (SS);somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO)","Vibrations;Wrist;Visualization;Electroencephalography;Steady-state;Electronic mail;Transient analysis","Attention;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Humans;Imagination;Male;Orientation;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch;Young Adult","30","","42","IEEE","24 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is applied to noninvasive EEG recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) for a healthy subject. A 1 mm hexahedra finite element volume conductor model of the subject's head was generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data. Special consideration was made to accurately model the skull and cerebrospinal fluid. An exhaustive search pattern and the MPSO method were then applied to the peak of the averaged SEP data and both identified the same region of the somatosensory cortex as the location of the SEP source. A clinical expert independently identified the expected source location, further corroborating the source analysis methods. The MPSO converged to the global minima with significantly lower computational complexity compared to the exhaustive search method that required almost 3700 times more evaluations.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2281435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623159","Electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization;finite element method (FEM);inverse problem;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);particle swarm optimization;somatosensory evoked potential (SEP);subtraction method","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Electric potential;Electrodes;Epilepsy;Inverse problems;Particle swarm optimization","Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Somatosensory Cortex","12","","54","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work utilized multi-channel TENS with diverse stimulus patterns to evoke sensations on four non-disabled subjects and two transradial amputees. Meanwhile, electroencephalogram (EEG) was collected to objectively assess the evoked sensations, where event-related potentials (ERPs), brain electrical activity maps (BEAMs), and functional connectivity (FC) were computed. The results show that various sensations could be successfully evoked for both amputees and non-disabled subjects by customizing stimulus parameters. The ERP confirmed the sensation and revealed the sensory-processing-related components like N100 and P200; the BEAMs confirmed the corresponding regions of somatosensory cortex were activated by stimulation; the FC indicated an increase of interactions between the regions of sensorimotor cortex.

However, the cortical mechanisms involved in roughness processing are not well understood. In the present study, we used behavioural data and event-related evoked potentials (ERPs) to investigate the extent to which two tactile stimuli varying in roughness (triangular gratings peak-to-peak spacing of 1.6 mm and 2.8 mm) and movement (the time available for tactile contact with the surface) modulate early stages of brain activation. Behavioral results showed that participants discriminate the two levels of roughness at the three velocities explored in the study but they were judged as equivalent in pleasantness. The ERP results showed a biphasic early-fast N1-P2 deflection. The N1 and P2 peaks to the smoother texture occur earlier than that of the rougher texture. Considering velocity, the N1 onset occurs later for the slowest velocity, followed by the intermediate velocity and earlier for the fastest velocity and the three velocities differ significantly.

Three types of touch stimuli: heat, bristles and pinch with varying intensity levels are utilized for the experiment. The brain signals acquired are analyzed using eLORETA software that confirms the involvement of frontal and parietal lobes for this cognitive activity. Additionally, frequency analysis undertaken infers the participation of alpha and theta bands for the said task. The signals are further evaluated to inspect the existence of any Event Related Potential (ERP) signal. A unique and notable ERP signal has been found when a subject finds the perceived stimuli to be painful. However, no relevant ERP component is generated when the subject finds the presented stimuli to be completely painless. A novel Interval Type-2 fuzzy classifier has been designed to classify these two distinct conditions (painful and non-painful). Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behaviour of the proposed classifier with respect to other standard ones. Moreover, statistical evaluation also assures the superior performance of the proposed classifier model. Hence, this method can act as a neuronal marker to detect an individual's pain sensitivity that can be used to diagnose and treat various neurological disorders and chronic pain based diseases.","","978-1-7281-4988-2","10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9182110","Pain perception;PIOOO;eLORTA;Type-2 fuzzy classifier","Pain;Electroencephalography;Finite impulse response filters;Sensitivity;Firing;IIR filters;Task analysis","","2","","14","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While optimizing the performance of a single task has long been the focus of BCI research, in order to translate this technology into everyday life, realistic situations, in which multiple tasks are performed simultaneously, must be investigated. In this paper, we explore the concept of cognitive flexibility, or multitasking, within the BCI framework by utilizing a 2-D cursor control task, using sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), and a four-target visual attention task, using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), both individually and simultaneously. We found no significant difference between the accuracy of the tasks when executing them alone (SMR—57.9% ± 15.4% and SSVEP—59.0% ± 14.2%) and simultaneously (SMR—54.9% ± 17.2% and SSVEP—57.5% ± 15.4%). These modest decreases in performance were supported by similar, non-significant changes in the electrophysiology of the SSVEP and SMR signals. In this sense, we report that multiple BCI tasks can be performed simultaneously without a significant deterioration in performance; this finding will help drive these systems toward realistic daily use in which a user’s cognition will need to be involved in multiple tasks at once.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2817924","NIH(grant numbers:AT009263); NIH(grant numbers:EB021027); NIH(grant numbers:NS096761,MH114233); NSF(grant numbers:CBET-1264782); NIH/NINDS Fellowship(grant numbers:F31NS096964); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8323419","Brain-computer interface;sensorimotor rhythms;steady-state visual evoked potential;multitasking;cognitive flexibility","Task analysis;Visualization;Light emitting diodes;Multitasking;Two dimensional displays;Rhythm;Steady-state","Adult;Attention;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cognition;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Eye Movements;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Psychomotor Performance;Young Adult","28","","52","OAPA","23 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on electroencephalogram (EEG) to study the relationship between the TENS parameters and the evoked somatosensory information for limb amputees. The experimental results demonstrated that different somatosensory information evoked by TENS at different body positions on a transradial amputee could be distinguished by the Event-Related Potential (ERP) characteristics such as frequency range, brain electrical activity mapping, latency, and shape feature of ERP segments. In addition, the high correlation of ERP curves obtained by the repeated experiments could approve the effectiveness and stability of our proposed method.

This work aims to investigate the influence of stimulation parameters on tactile sensation evoking, and evaluate the sensory feedback performance from the aspect of cerebral cortex activities. We recruited one transradial amputee and three able-bodied participants, studied the threshold and type of sensation evoking by adjusting the stimulation amplitude, pulse width and frequency, and compared the brain’s response behaviors between the amputee and the able-bodied by analyzing the event-related potential (ERP) and brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM). Experimental results show that the evoking threshold is determined by both pulse width and amplitude, and in general the able-bodied have higher thresholds than the amputee. For both types of participants, tactile sensations of vibration and pressure can be evoked at stimulation frequencies of 10 and 100 Hz, respectively. There is an obvious difference in cerebral cortex activation between the amputee and the able-bodied, where the former has a lower tactile acuity than the latter. ERP shows the able-bodied have stronger N1 activation, whereas the amputee has stronger N2 activation, and BEAM indicates distinct spatial distribution patterns of cortical areas associated with N1 and N2.

According to the “internal forward model,” the cerebellum generates predictions about somatosensory consequences of movements. These predictions simulate motor processes and prepare respective cortical areas for anticipated sensory input. Currently, there is very little evidence that a cerebellar forward model also applies to other sensory domains. In the current study, we address this question by examining the role of the cerebellum when auditory stimuli are anticipated as a consequence of a motor act. We applied an N100 suppression paradigm and compared the ERP in response to self-initiated with the ERP response to externally produced sounds. We hypothesized that sensory consequences of self-initiated sounds are precisely predicted and should lead to an N100 suppression compared with externally produced sounds. Moreover, if the cerebellum is involved in the generation of a motor-to-auditory forward model, patients with focal cerebellar lesions should not display an N100 suppression effect. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed a largely attenuated N100 suppression effect. The current results suggest that the cerebellum forms not only motor-to-somatosensory predictions but also motor-to-auditory predictions. This extends the cerebellar forward model to other sensory domains such as audition.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_00167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6794260","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Subjects received electrical stimulation to the ulnar nerve, while micro-ECoG recordings were acquired using a 32-channel microelectrode array placed on the dura above the primary so-matosensory cortex. Each pig received three sets of both noxious and non-noxious stimulations. The micro-ECoG recordings were transformed into short-time Fourier transforms, which were used as input to the CNN. ERPs were classified with an accuracy of 73.5% and AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve at 0.72. Additionally, the model was better at predicting non-noxious responses (85%) compared to noxious stimuli (62%). The developed CNN could classify between noxious and non-noxious ERP's recorded from pigs with a ROC-AUC at 0.72. In a further development process, the performance of the CNN model needs to be optimised and further research has to be conducted regarding the translation of the results from animal to human pain research.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123776","Danish National Research Foundation(grant numbers:DNRF121); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123776","CNN;EEG;nociception;pig;classification","Microelectrodes;Electric potential;Fourier transforms;Pain;Neural engineering;Receivers;Predictive models","","1","","16","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on maximum a posteriori probability (MAP), this method establishes the probabilistic models of human and robot control commands to realize the optimal control of a brain-actuated shared control system. Application on an intelligent Bayesian shared control system based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain machine interface (BMI) is presented for all-time continuous wheelchair navigation task. Moreover, to obtain more accurate brain control commands for shared controller and adapt the proposed system to the uncertainty of electroencephalogram (EEG), a hierarchical brain control mechanism with feedback rule is designed. Experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed system in several scenarios. Eleven subjects participated in our experiments and the results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2958076","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61836003,61573150,61573152,61633010); National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2017YFB1002500); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019MS138,2019MS113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8926386","Shared control;Bayesian approach;brain machine interface;wheelchair robot","Mobile robots;Wheelchairs;Robot kinematics;Control systems;Electroencephalography;Bayes methods","Adult;Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Biomechanical Phenomena;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Humans;Male;Psychomotor Performance;Robotics;Wheelchairs;Young Adult","54","","43","IEEE","6 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the hemodynamic activity underlying this differential process is still not clear. In this context, the simultaneous combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could unveil the hemodynamic correlates of neuronal events of interest, such as the N100, and inform on brain auditory processing with a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the single techniques. In this pilot work, we used EEG-driven fMRI and fMRI task-based connectivity analyses to investigate the neurovascular differences between two HCs and one SCZ during a three-tones auditory task. Although no differences were reported in terms of N100 amplitude, the EEG-driven fMRI analysis showed different N100 correlates between the two groups in the left insula, right prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. The different connectivity between participants and task conditions has been assessed using the left insula as seed for the generalized Psychophysiological Interactions (gPPI) model. The analysis showed generally lower connectivity for SCZ and alterations in regions included in the default mode and salience networks.","","979-8-3503-7800-9","10.1109/MetroXRAINE62247.2024.10796388","Italian Ministry of University and Research(grant numbers:2022RXM3H7); Italian Ministry of Health(grant numbers:GR-2018-12367290,PNC-E3-2022-23683266,C43C22001630001/MI-0117); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10796388","simultaneous EEG-fMRI;schizophrenia;auditory;correlates","Somatosensory;Visualization;Temporal lobe;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Schizophrenia;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Hemodynamics;Psychophysics;Spatial resolution","","","","26","IEEE","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dipole source locations were chosen to correspond to points along the somatosensory projection pathways to permit comparison of findings with clinical cortical and scalp evoked potential records. Data yielded by the theoretical head model compare well with those obtained experimentally. The results suggest that depth cerebral bioelectric sources can contribute to scalp recorded activity when averaging techniques are used.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.1978.326337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4122870","","Electroencephalography;Scalp;Bioelectric phenomena;Electric potential;Brain modeling;Magnetic heads;Signal generators;Audio recording;Delay;Humans","Animals;Cerebral Cortex;Electric Conductivity;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Haplorhini","51","","33","IEEE","12 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the emergence of collective behavior in a swarm is still difficult to predict and control. Nevertheless, human interaction with the swarm helps render the swarm more predictable and controllable, as human operators can utilize intuition or knowledge that is not always available to the swarm. Therefore, this letter designs the Dynamic Visualization Research Platform for Multimodal Human-Swarm Interaction (DVRP-MHSI), which is an innovative open system that can perform real-time dynamic visualization and is specifically designed to accommodate a multitude of interaction modalities (such as brain-computer, eye-tracking, electromyographic, and touch-based interfaces), thereby expediting progress in human-swarm interaction research. Specifically, the platform consists of custom-made low-cost omnidirectional wheeled mobile robots, multitouch screens and two workstations. In particular, the mutitouch screens can recognize human gestures and the shapes of objects placed on them, and they can also dynamically render diverse scenes. One of the workstations processes communication information within robots and the other one implements human-robot interaction methods. The development of DVRP-MHSI frees researchers from hardware or software details and allows them to focus on versatile swarm algorithms and human-swarm interaction methods without being limited to predefined and static scenarios, tasks, and interfaces. The effectiveness and potential of the platform for human-swarm interaction studies are validated by several demonstrative experiments.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2025.3560825","State Key Laboratory of Digital-Intelligent Modeling and Simulation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62203460,U22A2059); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10964715","Human-centered automation;multi-modal perception for HRI;multi-robot systems;semi-physical","Robots;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Visualization;Mobile robots;Heuristic algorithms;Electromyography;Workstations;Universal Serial Bus;Tracking","","","","32","CCBYNCND","14 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
