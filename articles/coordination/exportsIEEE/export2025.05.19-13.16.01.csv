However, the limitation of the decoding ability of motor imagery EEG signals still hinders the development of brain-computer interface technology. In this paper, we propose a spatial attention-based graph convolutional network (SAGCN) for motor imagery EEG signal classification. First, we initialize the adjacency matrix based on the functional connectivity of the raw EEG signals and extract the DE features of the original EEG signals as input. Subsequently, the channels that are of greater significance to the motor imagery EEG signals are identified through the spatial attention mechanism. Finally, the graph convolutional network is combined with the spatial attention matrix to obtain the classification results of EEG signals. We conduct experiments on two public datasets and the experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.","2157-8982","979-8-3315-4024-1","10.1109/IHMSC62065.2024.00014","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731514","motor imagery;EEG classification;graph convolutional networks;brain-computer interface","Graph convolutional networks;Human-machine systems;Pattern classification;Motors;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Cybernetics","","","","13","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous works to classify MI have obtained promising classification results. However, there still exit some challenges: 1) Although the deep learning (DL) models are the mainstream methods to solve MI classification, with their depths increasing, the accuracy gets saturated then degrades rapidly. 2) The complex and changeable relationship of the time sequence in the EEG signals makes it difficult to model. In this paper, we propose REEG-BTCNet, a novel framework that achieves outstanding accuracy with stronger robustness for EEG-based motor imagery classification. The REEG-BTCNet consists of residual compact convolution (RCV) module and bi-directional temporal convolution (BTCN) module. Specifically, the RCV module consists of convolution with residual connection to learn high-level task specific EEG feature. The BTCN module consists of a window splitting module and various bi-directional temporal convolutions blocks to model the temporal information from the MI-EEG signals. The proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques in the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset with an accuracy of 86.15% for the subject-dependent modes.

The DCNN aims to augment the network’s discriminative power and enhance classification accuracy. The proposed approach incorporates three main components: Daubechies wavelet transform, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), and CNN model.

CSP is utilized to select discriminative features that capture the differences between motor imagery tasks, finally the CNN model is trained to classify the EEG signals into different motor imagery categories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCNN surpasses baseline CNN models and achieves higher accuracy in classifying motor imagery EEG signals. Furthermore, the DCNN exhibits robustness to variations in EEG signal characteristics with accuracy of $85 \%$ while the existing methods classifies with accuracy of 79%.

In most applications, the EEG time interval on which feature extraction algorithms operate is fixed for all subjects, whereas the start time and the duration of motor imagery-based brain activities can vary from subject to subject. To improve the classification accuracy, this paper proposes a novel entropy-based algorithm to accurately identify the time interval that motor imagery has been performed. The proposed algorithm searches through different time intervals across trials and finds the one with minimum irregularity. The hypothesis behind the proposed algorithm is that when motor imagery is performed, the activities of the neurons in the motor cortex tend to become more synchronized and less irregular. We evaluate our proposed algorithm using a publicly available motor imagery-based BCI dataset.

This is a technique for extracting spatial features of motor imagery EEG signals based on graph convolution. Because the spatial features are highly stable and all time steps are included in the extraction of spatial features, the features extracted are macroscopic in nature. Based on the big data screening, we selected four excellent motor imagery EEG signal classification models and put the data of subjects who performed well on these models into the graph convolution model for supervised learning.

Finally, classification of four types motor imagery EEG was performed by a method based on the statistical theory. An average of 85% classification accuracy of the six type combination and the three subjects was achieved. The results showed that motor imagery EEG signals can be extracted using energy entropy and that these extracted features offered clear advantages for classification.","","978-0-7695-3619-4","10.1109/IUCE.2009.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223366","Brain computer interface;EEG;Time–frequency analysis;Energy entropy","Electroencephalography;Entropy;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Brain computer interfaces;Foot;Tongue;Signal to noise ratio;Signal analysis;Computer interfaces","","17","","26","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods typically extract TFS features first, then apply feature selection techniques to eliminate redundant information and select subject-specific EEG information. However, these existing feature selection methods often treat each one-dimensional TFS feature as an independent entity, overlooking the interdependencies and interactions between groups of TFS features. In this paper, we propose a novel feature recalibration network based on weight fusion to model the dependencies between sets of TFS features. Initially, the raw EEG signal undergoes sequential processing through time window segmentation, frequency band decomposition, and spatial feature extraction to obtain TFS features. The spatial features of each time-frequency unit are treated collectively as a feature map. Two data processing branches are then established to learn the channel weights of each feature map by leveraging global and local information through squeezing and excitation operations. Next, the two sets of channel weights are fused using a maxima operation, and the resulting fused channel weights are applied to scale each feature map, effectively recalibrating each set of TFS features. Finally, the recalibrated features are classified using two fully connected layers. Extensive experiments conducted on two public motor imagery EEG datasets, the proposed method achieved the highest average classification accuracies of 82.11% and 79.41%, respectively. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing feature selection and recalibration techniques, as well as most recent works. This demonstrates that modeling intergroup interdependencies and interactions of TFS features is effective for motor imagery classification.","","979-8-3503-5032-6","10.1109/ACCIS62068.2024.10948708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948708","EEG classification;Motor imagery;Feature selection;Feature recalibration;Time-frequency-spatial","Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Instruments;Feature extraction;Motors;Brain modeling;Data processing;Electroencephalography;Data mining","","","","36","IEEE","9 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EEG data recorded from each channel is first decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using the EMD analysis. In view of extracting discriminative information from the EEG signals corresponding to different MI tasks, we propose to utilize the entropy of band-limited IMF. Instead of considering all IMFs or first few IMFs, in the proposed method only the first IMF is chosen because of its low variance. In order to reduce the dimension of the feature vector consisting of entropy values from all channels, principal component analysis is performed. For the purpose of classification, train and test datasets are formed as per leave one out cross validation scheme and then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is carried out. Simulation is performed on publicly available MI dataset IVa of BCI Competition-III to classify the MI data in to two classes, namely right hand and right foot MI tasks.

Here, we use an autoencoder convolutional neural network to identify a low dimensional representation of the EEG signals from the first day (or days) and show that this allows for stable decoding performance on the following days without resorting to recalibration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the residual signals, namely the difference between the original and reconstructed EEG, can be used to accurately discriminate among different recording sessions. In line with that, the reconstructed EEG cannot be used to discriminate among recording sessions. This implies that the reconstructed EEG reflects an invariant representation of the subject's intent, whereas the residual signals reflect a non-stationary component, which differs from one session to another.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-scale attention two-step fusion network (MSA-TFN) that includes dual-path feature extraction, feature fusion, temporal modeling of fused features, and final classification. The dual-path feature extraction module captures EEG and fNIRS features independently, leveraging the advantages of both modalities. The multi-scale attention mechanism adaptively adjusts the fusion weights, and the two-step fusion strategy further enhances feature integration. Additionally, the Transformer module is introduced to capture long-range feature dependencies. This model was tested and evaluated using the publicly available TU-Berlin-A dataset, achieving an average accuracy of 83.29%, outperforming other state-of-the-art studies on the same dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","979-8-3315-2443-2","10.1109/CNTEIE66268.2024.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10987958","hybrid brain-computer interface;motor imagery;electroencephalogram(EEG);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);attention mechanism","Adaptation models;Attention mechanisms;Feature extraction;Motors;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Robustness;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution","","","","19","IEEE","12 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A motor imagery-based BCI enables patients to control artificial peripherals and communicate with the outside world by merely thinking of the task such as, e.g., the imagination of left-hand, right-hand, or foot movement. The mere intention of moving one of the limbs triggers neural activity, which is induced in the primary sensorimotor areas like that observed with real executed movements. Tracking generated sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) and extracting robust and informative features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are challenging due to the time-varying nature of EEG signals and the inter-human variability. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-zeros-time windowing (E2ZTW) approach based on a highly decaying window function to track SMRs and identify the temporal epochs containing useful information without any prior information on the trigger. The proposed approach involves the application of the group-delay function, allowing the improvement of the spectral resolution due to the additive property of the function on individual resonances. Some algorithms were integrated into the proposed approach, such as the common spatial pattern algorithm, which is used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis and a convolutional neural network, which are used for the classification of the features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking the SMRs rhythms is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Experiments were performed on three public datasets provided by BCI competition for 17 subjects. Following experimental results, it is shown that discrimination between the left- and right-hand movements can be achieved within a few seconds with high classification accuracy.

CSSP is an effective method for discriminating and classifying EEG signals in two-class motor imagery signals based on movement tasks. It has been implemented and compared to conventional CSP, as well as the optimized methods for such application. The meta-heuristic multi-objective non-dominated sorting GA algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to choose the optimal subset of channels among multi-channel EEG motor imagery signals in this investigation. The objective is to develop an optimal solution to the channel selection problem in order to select the ideal subset of channels from multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in brain-computer interface systems. The primary objective of the channel selection technique in EEG signal analysis is to obtain a limited number of channels so that the subject feels more at ease with the gel-based EEG electrodes. Additionally, this technique reduces the problem of overfitting in classification results when a significant number of redundant channels are available.

At present, most transfer learning algorithms applied in brain-computer interfaces still require a small number of labeled EEG samples from the current subject, and the classification accuracy is not high. The Riemannian space-based motor imagery EEG signal transfer learning fusion algorithm proposed in this paper does not require the current subject's labeled EEG samples and has a high classification accuracy.

Combining classifiers is an approach to improve the performance of complex problems. In this article we studied the application of combining classifiers based on wavelet features to improve the performance of EEG signal classification in BCI systems. Three normal subjects K3b, K6b and L1b were asked to perform imaginary movements of left hand, right hand, tongue and foot during predefined time interval.

Therefore, this article proposes a multi-scale feature learning method that combines DRSN and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) to enhance DRSN's ability to capture intermediate scale features. Through WPD, EEG signals are decomposed into different frequency bands, covering from () wave to $y$ wave. The different frequency ranges of waves enable the network to effectively capture intermediate scale signal features of dynamic changes such as event related potentials, EEG synchronization and desynchronization. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of DRSN on the BCI competition IV 2a and 2b datasets is increased to 84.45% and 91.26% after the introduction of WPD, which can ensure the effective recognition of MI EEG signals.","","979-8-3315-0739-8","10.1109/CISP-BMEI64163.2024.10906118","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806118); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906118","EEG signals;motor imagery;deep residual shrinkage network;wavelet packet decomposition;ERS;ERD","Time-frequency analysis;Image recognition;Accuracy;Face recognition;Noise reduction;Pattern classification;Motors;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","","","35","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies have shown that passive movement, which is directly observable, induces Event-Related Synchronization patterns that are similar to those induced from motor imagery. Hence, this paper investigates the feasibility of calibrating EEG-based motor imagery BCI from passive movement. EEG data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during motor imagery and passive movement of the hand by a haptic knob robot. The calibration models using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm on the EEG data from motor imagery were compared against using the EEG data from passive movement. The performances were compared based on the 10×10-fold cross-validation accuracies of the calibration data, and off-line session-to-session transfer kappa values to other sessions of motor imagery performed on another day. The results showed that the calibration performed using passive movement yielded higher model accuracy and off-line session-to-session transfer (73.6% and 0.354) than the calibration performed using motor imagery (71.3% and 0.311), and no significant differences were observed between the two groups (p=0.20, 0.23).

Functional connectivity between different temporal states is determined by the visibility between the vector’s norm and the norm of its projections onto subsequent time states. To create a weighted vector visibility graph using the connections among the nodes, it presents edge weights between the nodes using Gaussian kernels.

Currently, most researches focus on complex deep learning structures for MI decoding. The growing complexity of networks may result in overfitting and lead to inaccurate decoding outcomes due to the redundant information. To address this limitation and make full use of the multi-domain EEG features, a multi-domain temporal-spatial-frequency convolutional neural network (TSFCNet) is proposed for MI decoding. The proposed network provides a novel mechanism that utilize the spatial and temporal EEG features combined with frequency and time-frequency characteristics. This network enables powerful feature extraction without complicated network structure. Specifically, the TSFCNet first employs the MixConv-Residual block to extract multiscale temporal features from multi-band filtered EEG data. Next, the temporal-spatial-frequency convolution block implements three shallow, parallel and independent convolutional operations in spatial, frequency and time-frequency domain, and captures high discriminative representations from these domains respectively. Finally, these features are effectively aggregated by average pooling layers and variance layers, and the network is trained with the joint supervision of the cross-entropy and the center loss. Our experimental results show that the TSFCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy and kappa values (82.72% and 0.7695 for dataset BCI competition IV 2a, 86.39% and 0.7324 for dataset BCI competition IV 2b).

In the past 10-20 years, one of the popular areas of study related to the human brain is the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Different brain monitoring techniques such as EEG, fNIRS, MEG can be used to observe human brain activities in BCI systems. In addition to the differences in monitoring methods in BCI systems, the focus of system operation may also change. In some BCI systems, it may be preferable to focus on Motor Imagery in another system, while the focus is on the P300 signals in EEG data.

Zero-shot learning (ZSL), which can recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training, has the potential to substantially reduce the calibration time. Thus, in this context, we first try to use a new type of motor imagery task, which is a combination of traditional tasks and propose a novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize both known and unknown categories of EEG signals. This is achieved by first learning a non-linear projection from EEG features to the target space and then applying a novelty detection method to differentiate unknown classes from known classes. Applications to a dataset collected from nine subjects confirm the possibility of identifying a new type of motor imagery only using already obtained motor imagery data.

In order to solve the filtering problem, this paper uses the non-linear mapping function of the traditional BP neural network, and intelligently trains the small weight particles by combining the particle swarm filter algorithm, so as to improve the filtering performance of the whole BP algorithm. Based on the above two algorithms, the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unclean filtering in EEG data processing caused by fast weight degradation in traditional BP algorithm can be solved.

These differences can be attributed to active cortex regions, frequency bands and amplitude. In this paper, we use a deep learning method to explore the EEG patterns of key channels and the frequency band for stroke patients. The EEG data is bandpass filtered into multiple sub-bands split by a sliding window strategy.

Challenge of classifying motor imagery of these activities accurately could be solved by using individual BCI. We proposed to achieve the same by using a neural network (machine learning) classifier on high resolution (129 channel) EEG data evaluated continuously every 80ms after spatial filtering using spherical Laplacian.

A three layered neural network with two output nodes was created for classifying the motor imagery using power of 8-14 Hz band of 500 ms EEG data.

Two categories of features were utilized namely a high dimensional feature set extracted from 22 EEG channels and a feature set extracted from two EEG channels (C3 and C4). Four signal classifiers namely KNN, Regression tree, NB and LDA are applied on wavelet-based EEG signal features for discrimination of four classes of motor imagery (MI) tasks (left hand, right hand, foot and tongue). Efficient discrimination of motor imagery tasks is significantly dependent on signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals to enhance the performance of signal classifiers. A pre-processing technique is firstly applied on filtered EEG signals to remove contamination in the form of artifacts. Then, useful signal features are extracted from artifact free EEG signals, whereby relevant subsets with high predictive power are selected using feature selection technique.

So it is a state in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. The users provide training data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, and after the recording, different techniques and algorithms are used to learn patterns from the data in order to map them with a label or output. In this paper, we are interested to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this we show to our subject a video of a box that moves through a plane in three different directions, right, left, and forward. The mental task consists of imagining we are moving the box with our brain activity. Since embodiment provides greater accuracy in motor imagery, this kind of visual feedback, when there is no obvious congruity with any daily neural command, brings a greater difficulty than usual motor imagery. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a simple convolutional neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them.

Hence, an increasing trend in using deep learning for electroencephalograph (EEG) analysis is evident. Extracting relevant information from CNN features is one of the key reasons behind the success of the CNN-based deep learning models. Some CNN models use convolutional features from different CNN layers with good effect. However, extraction and fusion of multilevel convolutional features remain unexplored for EEG applications. Moreover, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence experience increasing applications in all fields. Cognitive process is based on understanding human brain cognition through signals, such as EEG. Hence, deep learning can aid in developing cognitive systems and related applications by improving EEG decoding. The classification and recognition of EEG have consistently been challenging due to its characteristics of dynamic time series data and low signal-to-noise ratio. However, the information hidden in different convolution layers can aid in improving feature discrimination capability. In this paper, we use the EEG motor imagery data to uncover the benefits of extracting and fusing multilevel convolutional features from different CNN layers, which are abstract representations of the input at various levels.

In addition, the time evolution of the WE is calculated to give information about the dynamics in the EEG records. Within this framework, the major objective of the present work was to characterize in a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in short duration EEG signals.

CSP is capable of discriminating two classes, but it is sensitive to outliers and noisy trials. Therefore, regularisation is often deployed to improve the robustness and accuracy of CSP estimation. In this paper, a novel regularisation approach based on shrinkage estimation is presented in order to handle small sample problem and retain subject-specific discriminative features. In this method, an analytical solution for shrinkage estimation is provided, which not only is computationally tractable, but also overcomes the heuristic approach of traditional cross validation based parameter tuning.

Secondly, five different filters are applied to the original signal and their outputs are utilized in the training of a CNN having the same structure.

The Rayleigh coefficient maximization was adopted to obtain the projection directions, which extract discriminating features from the preprocessed dataset. Next, both training and testing features are applied to construct an affinity matrix, and then both affinity matrix and all label information are applied to train a classifier based on graph-based semi-supervised method. In this approach, both labeled and unlabeled samples are used for training a classifier. Hence it can be used in small training data case.

In this study, a matrix decomposition technique, namely Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is adopted for feature extraction from time-frequency distributions (TFD) obtained by the Waveletbased Synchrosqueezing Transform (WSST). EEG signals were meticulously cleared of noise by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) before performing NMF.

Recent deep learning methods, which fail to fully explore both deep-temporal characterizations in EEGs itself and multi-spectral information in different rhythms, generally ignore the temporal or spectral dependencies in MI-EEG. Also, the lack of effective feature fusion probably leads to redundant or irrelative information and thus fails to achieve the most discriminative features, resulting in the limited MI-EEG decoding performance. To address these issues, in this paper, a MI-EEG decoding framework is proposed, which uses a novel temporal-spectral-based squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion network (TS-SEFFNet). First, the deep-temporal convolution block (DT-Conv block) implements convolutions in a cascade architecture, which extracts high-dimension temporal representations from raw EEG signals. Second, the multi-spectral convolution block (MS-Conv block) is then conducted in parallel using multi-level wavelet convolutions to capture discriminative spectral features from corresponding clinical subbands. Finally, the proposed squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion block (SE-Feature-Fusion block) maps the deep-temporal and multi-spectral features into comprehensive fused feature maps, which highlights channel-wise feature responses by constructing interdependencies among different domain features.

However, due to the non-linear and low signal-to-noise characteristics of EEG signal, the recognition of MI EEG signal remains a tricky problem. In this paper, a novel framework based on time-frequency analysis and spiking neural network (SNN) is proposed for feature extraction and classification of MI EEG signal. Specifically, the multi-wavelet basis functions (MWBF) are first employed for the approximation of coefficients in the time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model. An effective regularized orthogonal least squares (ROLS) algorithm is then applied to significantly simplify the model structure.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel domain-incremental learning framework for the continual motor imagery (MI) EEG classification. Specifically, to learn and retain common features between subjects, we separate latent representations into subject-invariant and subject-specific features through adversarial training, while also proposing an extensible architecture to preserve features that are easily forgotten.

However, EEG’s nonstationary nature and the susceptibility of its spatial-temporal features to brain conditions and environmental factors pose significant challenges. Most deep learning (DL) decoding networks tend to concentrate on local features, resulting in limitations when adapting to globalwise interdependencies. This article presents an end-to-end multibranch and fusion transformer (MBFT) framework to focus on and fuse full-sequence length spatial-temporal spectral information through self-attention, thereby adaptively capturing key elements in EEG signals. MI-EEG encompasses rhythmic characteristics of multiple spectra throughout the entire sequence and with intrasequence interdependencies. To learn the global patterns of local features from multiple frequency bands in parallel, MBFT employs a multibranch transformer encoder (TE) structure and further utilizes multihead self-attention (MSA) to acquire fused high-level features. Our proposed model demonstrates superior performance on various datasets. It achieves an average accuracy of 86.93% on the BCIC IV-2a dataset, 94.64% on the BCIC II and III datasets, and 93.52% on the MMIDB dataset, all achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Although multitask autoencoder (MTAE) techniques have recently been used to mitigate this issue, these approaches encounter an imbalance problem between loss functions with different objectives, particularly between reconstruction loss and cross-entropy. To address this, we propose a novel two-phase multitask autoencoder (2PMTAE) framework that not only rectifies the imbalance issue but also ensures stable training of the MTAE. Our framework comprises two phases: first, the generation of a class-specific target signal, and second, the calculation of the reconstruction loss based on the generated target signals, effectively aligning the objectives of the two loss functions. In subject-independent experiments, our proposed method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, achieving accuracies of 71.68% and 75.78% on the BCI competition IV-2a and OpenBMI datasets, respectively.

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, it is not easy to accurately classify motor imagery signals, especially for multiple classification tasks. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a spatial transformation method that can effectively extract spatial features of EEG signals. However, the covariance matrix is inaccurate due to the small training data size,. Thus, in this paper, a regularization parameter auto-selection algorithm is proposed to automatically adjust the ratio of the covariance matrix calculated by other subjects’ data based on the mutual information. It can be used to tackle the problem of an inaccurate mixed covariance matrix caused by fixed regularization parameters.To illustrate the merits of the proposed Auto-selected Filter Bank Regularized Common Spatial Pattern (AFBRCSP), we used the ten folds cross-validation accuracy and Kappa as the evaluation metrics to evaluate two data sets (BCI4-2a and BCI3a data set). Both data set include four mental classes. By using BCI4-2a data set, we found that the mean accuracy of AFBRSP is 77.31% and the Kappa is 0.6975, which is higher than Filter Bank Regularized Common Spatial Pattern (FBRCSP) by 5.67% and 0.0756, respectively. By using BCI3a data set, the proposed AFBRCSP improved the accuracy by 8.34% and the Kappa by 0.1111 compared with FBRCSP where the mean accuracy of AFBRCSP is 80.56%, and the kappa is 0.7407. The overall Kappa obtained by the proposed method is also higher than some state-of-the-art methods, implying that the proposed method is more reliable.","2326-8301","978-1-6654-7251-7","10.1109/ISMICT56646.2022.9828164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9828164","Brain-Computer Interface;Motor imagery;Electroencephalogram","Filter banks;Training data;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Reliability;Covariance matrices","","3","","17","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve the classification accuracy of multi-class motor imagery EEG, an EEG recognition method based on channel frequency selection is proposed. First, the original EEG signals are filtered by different frequency bands, and the corresponding band power can be calculated. Then the separability information of each frequency band is obtained by using the Fisher distance. Several bands with the maximum Fisher distance in each channel are selected for filtering. Finally, the feature vector of the filtered EEG signal is extracted by one-versus-one CSP (OVO-CSP) and classified by support vector machine (SVM). The public dataset of four-class motor imagery EEG is applied to evaluate this method. The results indicate that the classification accuracy and the Kappa coefficient achieved by the proposed method can reach 86.85% and 0.825 respectively, remarkably higher than the traditional method using a broad band.

Most current works on this issue require a subject-specific adaptation step before applied to a new user. Thus the research of directly extending a pre-trained model to new users is particularly desired and indispensable. As brain dynamics fluctuate considerably across different subjects, it is challenging to design practical hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge. Regarding this gap, this paper proposes a Graph-based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Model (G-CRAM) to explore EEG features across different subjects for motor imagery classification. A graph structure is first developed to represent the positioning information of EEG nodes. Then a convolutional recurrent attention model learns EEG features from both spatial and temporal dimensions and emphasizes on the most distinguishable temporal periods. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark EEG datasets of motor imagery classification on the subject-independent testing. The results show that the G-CRAM achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods regarding recognition accuracy and ROC-AUC.

Accurate investigation and analysis of the EEG signals from a subject can interpret the inherent information about the intention of the person to some extent. The accuracy of such interpretation or detection can be of utmost importance for various brain computer interface (BCI) based applications. For instance, within the last decade, BCI has been widely investigated and employed to assist in the restoration of sensory and motor functions in paralyzed individuals. EEG typically contains numerous information about the cognitive thinking and intention of a person, particularly in terms of motor movements. Due to this, comprehensive methods of EEG signal arrangement and pattern recognition through signal classification techniques are required to precisely predict the intended set of movements. In this study, an EEG classification technique based on a combination of wavelet transform analysis and Neural Networks (NN) is presented. Daubechies wavelet decomposition (db8) has been employed to decompose the recorded EEG signals into four levels. These decomposed level details are then used to calculate the feature set which is input to NN classifier for further classification. A total of 6 features were used to perform feature wise classification, where Integrated EEG (IEEG) feature set has been found to possess the highest classification accuracy of 89.39 % with a NN classifier of 9 hidden layers.

The preprocessed EEG data were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to calculate spectral power in the δ (0.5-3 Hz), θ (4–7 Hz), $a$ (8–13 Hz), and β (13–30 Hz) frequency bands. Subsequently, seventeen fatigue-related metrics were calculated using individual spectral powers and their combinations. These fatigue-related metrics were averaged for the frontal lobe (F3 and F4), central lobe (FCC3h and FCC4h), parietal lobe (P3 and P4), and occipital lobe (POO1 and POO2).

However, due to distortions in the temporal and local information of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability, it is very time-consuming to perform a calibration procedure designed in a subject-specific manner, which requires a large number of labeled samples. To this end, we construct EEG brain graph based on EEG electrode distribution and propose a new subdomain adversarial network for learning domain-invariant features to achieve cross-domain classification of motor imagery EEG signals. Specifically, the proposed method constructs a brain graph based on the spatial distribution of electrodes and their functional connections, and builds EEG graph data.

Some traditional methods usually extract the frequency or spatial features without considering the related information between different channels that would affect the classification performance. This paper proposes a new method for feature extraction of EEG signals based on the fusion of time-frequency and spatial features. At the beginning, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is adopted to extract the spatial features. Then the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) are used to extract the µ rhythm of the motor imagery EEG signals as the time-frequency features. After that, by combining the spatial and time-frequency features, the time-frequency-spatial feature is formed. Based on different kinds of features, the experimental data are classified by using the support vector machine (SVM), as well as the sparse representation classification (SRC) algorithm with the elastomeric network (EN) and L1 norm, respectively. The experimental results show that the SRC with EN has a better performance on either the time-frequency feature or spatial feature than the SRC with L1 norm does. In contrast, the SVM and the SRC with Ll norm perform better than the SRC with EN based on the time-frequency-spatial feature. The study concludes that the time-frequency-spatial feature cooperating with the certain classifiers can achieve the good classification effect for the MI EEG signals, which not only reduces the operation time but also improves the classification accuracy.","2767-9861","978-1-6654-2423-3","10.1109/DDCLS52934.2021.9455464","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806033,61703065); National Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyj-msxm1555); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN202000625); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9455464","Common Spatial Pattern;Feature Fusion;Motor Imagery;Sparse Representation;SVM;Wavelet Analysis","Support vector machines;Time-frequency analysis;Transforms;Feature extraction;Minimization;Rhythm;Electroencephalography","","6","","22","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and incomplete EEG signals, high accuracy rate classification is still a challenging problem. Most existing works of deep learning only regard EEG signals as chain-like sequences data and use single neural network for classification. To solve the above issues, we propose an improved EEG signals classification method via a hybrid neural network (HNN).

Then, the EEG signals are divided into some small segments, and we arrange the data by considering the spatial position of electrodes. Finally, we propose a hybrid neural network by combing CNN, DNN, LSTM network. Experimental results for two challenging EEG signal classification benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has a good classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art EEG signal classification algorithms.

Since EEG recordings suffer from heterogeneity across subjects and labeled data insufficiency, designing a classifier that performs the MI independently from the subject with limited labeled samples would be desirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel subject-independent semi-supervised deep architecture (SSDA). The proposed SSDA consists of two parts: an unsupervised and a supervised element. The training set contains both labeled and unlabeled data samples from multiple subjects. First, the unsupervised part, known as the columnar spatiotemporal auto-encoder (CST-AE), extracts latent features from all the training samples by maximizing the similarity between the original and reconstructed data. A dimensional scaling approach is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the representations while preserving their discriminability. Second, a supervised part learns a classifier based on the labeled training samples using the latent features acquired in the unsupervised part. Moreover, we employ center loss in the supervised part to minimize the embedding space distance of each point in a class to its center. The model optimizes both parts of the network in an end-to-end fashion. The performance of the proposed SSDA is evaluated on test subjects who were not seen by the model during the training phase. To assess the performance, we use two benchmark EEG-based MI task datasets. The results demonstrate that SSDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods and that a small number of labeled training samples can be sufficient for strong classification performance.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3360194","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CCF-1934962,DGE-1922591); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10416682","Brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;motor imagery;semi-supervised deep architecture","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Feature extraction;Training;Recording","Humans;Electroencephalography;Machine Learning;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Learning;Benchmarking;Algorithms;Imagination","3","","55","CCBYNCND","30 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm to improve the classification success rate of MI-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in BCIs. The proposed scheme develops a novel cross-correlation based feature extractor, which is aided with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) for two-class MI signals recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the LS-SVM classifier by a logistic regression classifier and a kernel logistic regression classifier, separately, with the same features extracted from the cross-correlation technique for the classification. The proposed approach is tested on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III. The performances of those methods are evaluated with classification accuracy through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. We also assess the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with eight recently reported algorithms. Experimental results on the two datasets show that the proposed LS-SVM classifier provides an improvement compared to the logistic regression and kernel logistic regression classifiers.

Firstly, on the basis of analyzing channels and frequency bands closely related to event desynchronization, wavelet packet decomposition was carried out for EEG signals to extract the activity imagination EEG co-rhythms and beta rhythms. Spatial filtering was carried out to extract features through the CSP algorithm, and then the related nodes were selected to calculate the wavelet packet energy.

The existence of outliers leads to a degradation of the classification performance of MI-based BCI (MI-BCI).

This paper presents a generalized Lp-norm based CSP (p<1) to yield robustness to outliers for MI-BCI. By utilizing the Lp-norm dispersion of the filtered EEG samples instead of L2-norm or L1-norm ones, the robust MI-BCI to outliers is expected.

Many studies have recently focused on identifying and quantifying important frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI), recorded through EEG. However, there is still a lack of an optimal methodology for recognizing users with EEG-based MI. Therefore, we aimed to propose an EEG-MI methodology that utilizes optimized feature extraction methods and classifiers to improve user-aware accuracy. To accomplish this goal, we extracted four features related to MI and compared the accuracies for recognizing users using a support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB). We then used the half-total error rate (HTER) to determine whether the results were reliable due to an imbalance problem caused by the differences in the data sizes. Thus, we used a common spatial pattern (CSP) to achieve the highest user identification accuracies of 98.97% and 97.47% using SVM and GNB, respectively. All user recognition accuracies are guaranteed by the HTERs, which are below 0.5. However, CSP has the disadvantage of decreasing accuracy on a small dataset scale. Therefore, we proposed and tested a statistical methodology for estimating a minimum dataset scale to ensure CSP performance. We confirm that the used dataset adequately guarantees CSP performance. This study makes a great contribution to the field of information security by presenting an EEG-MI methodology that improves the identification accuracy in human biometrics based on EEG-MI signals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268551","Advanced Institutes of Convergence Technology(grant numbers:AICT-2023-0003); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of BCI-Based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions Using Deep Learning)(grant numbers:2017-0-00451); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105200","Biometric;electroencephalography (EEG);motor imagery (MI);support vector machine (SVM);user identification methodology;Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB)","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Biometrics (access control);Task analysis;Reliability;Electrodes","","9","","74","CCBYNCND","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, EEG recordings are more susceptible to movement artifacts and capture a lower frequency of neural activity when compared with invasive techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG).

The effects of mental practice on motor skill learning are the result of practice on central motor programming. According to this view, it seems logical that mental practice should modify the neuronal activity in the primary sensorimotor areas. This article explores the use of independent component analysis (ICA) approach to characterize the effect of mental practice and concentration skills on EEG patterns during motor imagery. The results indicate that the mental training has a significant effect on spatial-temporal EEG during motor imagery. It is observed that the power of delta and theta bands increases following the visual cue and alpha activity is significantly suppressed. Increase of gamma activities starts almost 1000 ms after the visual stimulus and continues to the end of imagination. Increase of theta activities can be associated with engagement of the working memory during motor imagery and represents the memory load. The interesting result is that the mental training dramatically enhances motor-cortex rhythm. It is found that ICA can successfully detect and separate different brain activities into separate components during motor imagery.","","0-7803-8439-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1403136","EEG;brain-computer interface;independent component analysis;motor imagery","Electroencephalography;Independent component analysis;Electrodes;Computerized monitoring;Grasping;Rhythm;Brain computer interfaces;Muscles;Blind source separation;Sampling methods","","8","","7","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The intersubject decoding ability is crucial for the application of MI-BCI, which implies that the subject can use MI-BCI equipment without recording additional data for training. Physiologically, because of the distinction in the imagery method, brain structure, and brain state, the intersubject data distribution of MI EEG data is different. This often leads to a partial or even complete failure of the MI decoding algorithm between subjects. To solve these issues, we propose a novel deep learning method called the spatial and conditional domain adaption network (SCDAN), which aims to adapt the intersubject MI EEG data. In SCDAN, three innovative structures are employed: a parallel temporal–spatial convolution feature extractor, a spatial discriminator, and a conditional discriminator. The feature extractor adopts an improved temporal–spatial convolutional network that has a more reasonable structure and fewer parameters to reduce the risk of intersubject overfitting. The spatial discriminator and conditional discriminator calibrate the training processing to help the feature extractor learn the intersubject common feature representation. We evaluate the performance of SCDAN on the GigaScience dataset and the 2a BCI Competition IV dataset using both one-to-one and leave-one-out transfer protocols. For the one-to-one transfer protocol, the classification accuracies of SCDAN improve by 5.70% and 12.43% compared with the baseline method. And for the leave-one-out transfer protocol, the improvements are 8.60% and 15.84%, respectively.

Nevertheless, challenges in accurately decoding brain signals limit the broader application of this technology. In this study, we propose the CAT-CNN-TRFM network, designed for EEG-based MI classification. The network employs a channel attention mechanism to selectively enhance relevant EEG channels. A convolutional module is subsequently used to extract spatiotemporal features, followed by a Transformer encoder to model global dependencies through multi-head attention. Finally, a fully connected layer handles the classification of signals. On the BCI IV2a dataset, CAT-CNN-TRFM achieves an average accuracy of 81.25%.

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines deep learning and data augmentation for EEG classification. We applied the empirical mode decomposition on the EEG frames and mixed their intrinsic mode functions to create new artificial EEG frames, followed by transforming all EEG data into tensors as inputs of the neural network by complex Morlet wavelets. We proposed two neural networks-convolutional neural network and wavelet neural network-to train the weights and classify two classes of motor imagery signals. The wavelet neural network is a new type of neural network using wavelets to replace the convolutional layers. The experimental results show that the artificial EEG frames substantially improve the training of neural networks, and both two networks yield relatively higher classification accuracies compared to prevailing approaches.

An effective Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system basically consists of three operations which are signal recording, feature extraction and classification. Efficient and reliable classification of EEG signal for motor imagery (MI) based BCI system depends on the accuracy of denoising and extracted features of the signal. Extracted features are intended to be lossless key information obtained from a signal that describes a dataset accurately. It is important to minimize the classification complexity and maximize the accuracy. Traditional strategies can be used to process the signal, but the diverseness of the EEG signal conceivably could not be depicted utilizing a linear analytical approach. Hence, this paper adopted the power spectral density (PSD) feature extraction technique to extract the features based on various frequency transformations that enhance the classification performance.

We deployed various feature extraction techniques for EEG data using wavelet transform and common spatial pattern. For the wavelet features, statistical values, energy, entropy and band power were used to form the desired feature vectors. Before extracting wavelet coefficients, we performed two scenarios, with and without surface laplacian filter around the channels C3, C4 and Cz. Three types of classifiers were employed for classification, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The aim of this work is to compare between them and to recommend the suitable combination for synchronous two-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. The data were recorded from five subjects, provided by BCI-Competition III. The results show that SVM is more suitable with the features than those extracted from wavelet coefficients and combination of entropy-energy-band power, and LDA is more suitable with common spatial pattern.

It is, however, known that the nature of the motor imagery related EEG signals is highly dependent on the subjects and variable over trial to trial. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method of optimizing discriminative spatial filters on a time domain in each frequency band.

A network called MSCARNet, which combines multi-scale convolution and Riemannian geometry, was proposed for classifying motor imagery based on EEG. The network is supplemented by an attention mechanism and sliding window technique. The MSCARNet utilizes sliding windows to expand data dimensions and multiple convolution kernels to obtain spatial and temporal features. These features are then mapped to Riemannian space and undergo bilinear mapping and logarithmic operations for dimensionality reduction. This approach is beneficial in reducing the impact of noise and outliers and provides convenience for classification. Subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments were conducted using the BCI-IV-2a dataset to validate the effectiveness of the MSCARNet.

These systems convert different MI EEG input signals to directives, so their performances depend on the efficiency of the embedded signal classification algorithm. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning in classifying the MI EEG data. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is used to construct the scalograms, which serve as the inputs to the deep learning structure. The efficacies of five pre-trained networksAlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and ShuffleNet-are evaluated on the BCI competition IV data set 2a. Binary (left hand vs. right hand) and four-class (left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue) classifications are trained and tested using fivefold cross validation. The result indicates that using the CWT with transfer learning models provides very high classification accuracies. The ResNet18 network achieves the best accuracies in both cases at 95.03±2.95% and 91.86±2.90%, respectively. In addition, we examine the effect of different time-frequency features on the classification performance by comparing the scalogram of the CWT and the spectogram of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as the inputs.

To improve data fusion methodologies, we investigate the impact of a 1D or 2D representation when a visual feedback is given during motor imagery task. Results show a better synergy between EEG and fMRI when a 2D display is used. Subjects have better fMRI scores when 1D is used for bi-modal EEG-fMRI NF sessions; on the other hand, they regulate EEG more specifically when the 2D metaphor is used.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-9330-8","10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098591","EEG;fMRI;bi-modal;data fusion","Two dimensional displays;Noise measurement;Electroencephalography;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Task analysis;Correlation","","1","","11","IEEE","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant inter-individual variability in EEG signals further limits model generalization. Concurrently, the use of self-supervised pre-training, particularly through masked modeling, is gaining traction in time series analysis to mitigate labeling costs. Although this method involves reconstructing masked signal from unmasked series, random masking can disrupt critical temporal variations, complicating effective representation learning. We thus introduce SSL-MEMI, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for masked EEG motor imagery modeling, integrating Domain Adaptive Alignment (DAA) and Multi-View Temporal-spatial Attention module (MTSA) to effectively handle EEG variability. This framework utilizes manifold-based masking to reconstruct original sequences from masked series, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. When tested on the BCI Competition IV and High Gamma datasets, SSL-MEMI outperforms existing methods, achieving top accuracies and demonstrating superior domain adaptation through reduced Global ${\mathcal{A}}$-distance scores.

In EEG-based BCI systems, power spectral density (PSD) is an efficient and widely used frequency feature, but the performance may degrade seriously when applied to data with low SNR. To improve the performance of EEG feature extraction, in this paper, we attempt to use the correntropy spectral density (CSD) as an EEG feature, and further combine the CSD and PSD together to construct a combinatorial EEG feature, called CSD & PSD. Firstly, an experiment on artificial EEG data is performed to validate that the CSD is more suitable for non-Gaussian and low SNR signal analysis. Then, the PSD, CSD and CSD & PSD are used to extract features of real motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. The results show that CSD & PSD often outperforms both PSD and CSD in different noise scenarios, which validate that the weighted combination feature CSD & PSD inherits the characteristics of CSD and PSD, and it is more suitable for EEG signal analysis in various SNRs.","2688-0938","978-1-7281-4094-0","10.1109/CAC48633.2019.8996873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8996873","EEG;power spectral density;correntropy spectral density","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Signal to noise ratio;Frequency modulation;Robustness;Kernel;Support vector machines","","12","","25","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram plays a critical role in BCI applications. To address the problem of lack of control instruction sets for brain-computer interfaces based on motor imagery, this paper proposes the use of a variable-length coding strategy to control the movement of a KUKA robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The motor imagery EEG signals are classified into four categories by using common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The classification results of the left-hand and right-hand motor imagery are encoded with binary Huffman Coding, and the codewords are mapped to 7 degrees of freedom of the robotic arm. The number of occurrences of each Huffman codeword is used to control the rotation angle of the corresponding degree of freedom. The classification results of tongue and feet motor imagery are used to enter and exit the selection of the degrees of freedom of the robotic arm, respectively. In the designed object grasping and placing scene, the instruction control using Huffman variable-length coding strategy reduces the time by 19 and 18 times, and the efficiency increases by 23.4% and 20.2%, respectively, compared with the use of binary fixed-length coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of Huffman coding enables the control of multiple degrees of freedom of a robotic arm using finite motor imagery classification categories. The method can improve the information transfer efficiency and expand the set of control instructions for brain-computer interfaces, which provides new ideas for the application scenarios of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces.","","978-1-6654-3153-8","10.1109/M2VIP49856.2021.9665060","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665060","motor imagery;EEG signals;Huffman Coding;robotic arm;brain-computer interface","Support vector machines;Tongue;Instruction sets;Stroke (medical condition);Manipulators;Brain-computer interfaces;Encoding","","1","","24","IEEE","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, training data scarcity usually occurs in subject-specific motor imagery tasks unless multisubject data can be used to enlarge training data. Unfortunately, because of the large discrepancies between data distributions from different subjects, model performance could only be improved marginally or even worsened by simply training on multisubject data. Method: This article proposes a novel weighted multi-branch (WMB) structure for handling multisubject data to solve the problem, in which each branch is responsible for fitting a pair of source-target subject data and adaptive weights are used to integrate all branches or select branches with the largest weights to make the final decision. The proposed WMB structure was applied to six well-known deep learning models (EEGNet, Shallow ConvNet, Deep ConvNet, ResNet, MSFBCNN, and EEG_TCNet) and comprehensive experiments were conducted on EEG datasets BCICIV-2a, BCICIV-2b, high gamma dataset (HGD) and two supplementary datasets. Result: Superior results against the state-of-the-art models have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method in subject-specific motor imagery EEG classification. For example, the proposed WMB_EEGNet achieved classification accuracies of 84.14%, 90.23%, and 97.81% on BCICIV-2a, BCICIV-2b and HGD, respectively.

Despite recent advancements, learning diversified EEG features across different frequency ranges remains a significant challenge, as the homogenization of feature representations often limits the generalization capabilities of EEG decoding models for BCIs. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale convolutional transformer framework for EEG decoding that integrates multiscale convolution, transformer, and diverse-aware feature learning scheme (MCTD) to tackle the above challenge. Specifically, we first capture multiple frequency features using dynamic one-dimensional temporal convolution with different kernel lengths. Subsequently, we incorporate convolutional layers and transformers with a contrastive learning scheme to extract discriminative local and global EEG features within a single frequency range. To mitigate the homogenization of features extracted from different frequency ranges, we propose a novel decorrelation regularization. It enables multiscale convolutional transformers produce less correlated features with each other, thereby enhancing the overall expressiveness of EEG decoding model. The performance of MCTD is evaluated on four public MI-based EEG datasets, including the BCI competition III 3a and IV 2a, the BNCI 2015- 001, and the OpenBMI. For the average Kappa/Accuracy scores, MCTD obtains improvements of 3.58%/2.68%, 3.09%/2.20%, 2.33%/1.54%, and 4.44%/2.22%, over the state-of-the-art method on four EEG datasets, respectively.

The session-to-session transfer BCI is characterized by high classification accuracy, but there is a limitation that the model could not be improved as the number of subjects increased. On the other hand, the subject-independent BCI has advantage in increasing the number of subjects, but had the problem of requiring too many subjects for high accuracy.

The weight coefficients are determined by the  $\ell_1$-minimization problem that lead to sparse weights such that almost zero-values are allocated to low-quality trials.

Given that the temporal dimension of EEG signals far exceeds its channel dimension, researchers generally tend to explore the temporal context information of EEG signals to capture the subtle differences in Motor Imagery (MI), while relatively ignoring the importance of different electrode channels. In fact, cross-channel information contains an intrinsic semantic structure that is indispensable for improving the classification performance of EEG signals. In the feature extraction stage, enhancing the weight of the channels related to motor imagery while reducing the weight of unrelated channels can facilitate the extraction of spatial semantic features in EEG signals, thus improving the classification accuracy. The key to deeper decoding of the brain's cognitive functions is how to synchronously parse and represent the spatial and temporal dimensional properties of neural activities with high temporal resolution. In this paper, we innovatively propose a Swin Transformer with Channel Attention Network model, Swin-CANet, which aims to extract and construct superior, robust, and discriminative spatiotemporal feature representations from raw EEG signals and reveal the deep-level correlations between spatiotemporal features. Further, we design a lightweight module, Swin-CA Block, effectively reducing the computational complexity. We prove the effectiveness and superiority of the Swin-CANet model on the BCI IV-2a dataset. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of Swin-CAN et is improved by 4.28% to 11.03% compared with the existing five models.","","979-8-3503-7434-6","10.1109/SEAI62072.2024.10674039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10674039","EEG classification;Motor imagery;Transformer;Brain Computer Interface;Attention","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Semantics;Neural activity;Feature extraction;Transformers;Motors","","","","20","IEEE","20 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the poor spatial resolution of the MI-EEG signals, the cortical area (source) activating the MI cannot be located accurately with the EEG (sensor) signal, which might degrade the classification accuracy. This study adopts the EEG source imaging (ESI) technique to estimate the cortical area where source ERD happens from the EEG signal. An improved ESI method based on the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithm, in which an average LCMV filter and an average baseline covariance are constructed for the ESI, is proposed to locate the activated cortical area from the noisy EEG signals. The source ERD features are then extracted. Analytical results show that, for subjects with obvious average source ERD phenomenon, their activated cortical area in a single-trial MI can be well located.

The calibration burden during data acquisition phase will most probably cause a subject to be reluctant to use a BCI system. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel sparse group representation model (SGRM) for improving the efficiency of MI-based BCI by exploiting the intersubject information. Specifically, preceded by feature extraction using common spatial pattern, a composite dictionary matrix is constructed with training samples from both the target subject and other subjects. By explicitly exploiting within-group sparse and group-wise sparse constraints, the most compact representation of a test sample of the target subject is then estimated as a linear combination of columns in the dictionary matrix. Classification is implemented by calculating the class-specific representation residual based on the significant training samples corresponding to the nonzero representation coefficients. Accordingly, the proposed SGRM method effectively reduces the required training samples from the target subject due to auxiliary data available from other subjects. With two public EEG data sets, extensive experimental comparisons are carried out between SGRM and other state-of-the-art approaches. Superior classification performance of our method using 40 trials of the target subject for model calibration (Averaged accuracy = 78.2%, Kappa = 0.57 and Averaged accuracy = 77.7%, Kappa = 0.55 for the two data sets, respectively) indicates its promising potential for improving the practicality of MI-based BCI.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2832538","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91420302,61573142,61501164,61703407); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WH1516018,222201717006); Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities(grant numbers:B17017); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:14.756.31.0001); Polish National Science Center(grant numbers:2016/20/W/N24/00354); Foundation of Key Laboratory of Science and Technology for National Defense(grant numbers:6142222030301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8353425","Brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);sparse group representation model (SGRM);common spatial pattern (CSP)","Electroencephalography;Training;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Calibration;Informatics;Dictionaries","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Machine Learning;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","153","","77","IEEE","2 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AE-FBCSP is an extension of the well-established FBCSP and is based on a global (cross-subject) and subsequent transfer learning subject-specific (intra-subject) approach. A multi-way extension of AE-FBCSP is also introduced in this paper. Features are extracted from high-density EEG (64 electrodes), by means of FBCSP, and used to train a custom AE, in an unsupervised way, to project the features into a compressed latent space. Latent features are used to train a supervised classifier (feed forward neural network) to decode the imagined movement. The proposed method was tested using a public dataset of EEGs collected from 109 subjects. The dataset consists of right-hand, left-hand, both hands, both feet motor imagery and resting EEGs. AE-FBCSP was extensively tested in the 3-way classification (right hand vs left hand vs resting) and also in the 2-way, 4-way and 5-way ones, both in cross- and intra-subject analysis. AE-FBCSP outperformed standard FBCSP in a statistically significant way (p > 0.05) and achieved a subject-specific average accuracy of 89.09% in the 3-way classification. The proposed methodology performed subject-specific classification better than other comparable methods in the literature, applied to the same dataset, also in the 2-way, 4-way and 5-way tasks.

The paper proposes a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) of EEG recorded during bilateral imagined hand movement. CCA determines linear transformation of EEG that is maximally correlated with a transformed version of neural response to imagined movement. In the proposed method, the linear weights are identified for the spatial and spectral components of EEG signal. The study investigates how the CCA-based transformation of the signal improves discrimination between two movement classes. Further, two parallel CCA blocks, determine two transformations of EEG, one that maximizes correlation with the corresponding class, and other that minimizes the correlation with the mismatched class. Features derived using this approach are used for single-trial classification of bilateral imagined hand movement. Time-frequency patterns of EEG derived from the proposed approach illustrate their discriminative ability in mu and beta bands. An average classification accuracy of 61.12% (109 subjects) and 73.34% (Best 40 subjects) are obtained.

Then, The rhythms mu and beta are isolated using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithm with a db4 mother wavelet of level 5. The proposed system has two outputs: the coefficients of the DWT related to the rhythms mu and beta; and a feature vector with three chosen features that can be used as an input to a classifier.

In this study, we propose, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a novel data adaptive empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based signal decomposition method for improving the classification accuracy of MI based EEG signals. Specifically, to reduce the system complexity and execution time, the proposed method selects 18 electrodes out of 118 to analyze the non-stationary and nonlinear EEG signal behaviors. Meanwhile, the method adopts the Welch power spectral density (PSD) analysis method for single mode selection out of the total 10 for each channel, and the Hilbert transform (HT) method for both instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF) signal components extraction for each selected mode. With seven commonly used machine-learning classifiers adopted, extensive experiments were conducted with the benchmark dataset IVa from BCI competition III to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that with the IA and IF component features being tested using the least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier, the EWT method achieves an average classification accuracy of 95.2% and 94.6% respectively, which is higher as compared with the existing methods. While for every participant, a classification accuracy of at least 80% could be achieved by employing a single feature only. Results also show that a combination of EWT and higher order statistics features, which contain both kurtosis and skewness of the extracted instantaneous components, help achieve a higher success rate. The better performances of EWT over those of the existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of EWT for BCI system applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939623","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61705184,51875477); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018JQ6014); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:G2018KY0308); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M641013); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:ZZ2019028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8825825","Brain-computer interface;motor imagery;electroencephalography;empirical wavelet transform;higher order statistics","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Transforms;Brain modeling;Pattern classification;Brain-computer interfaces","","120","","70","CCBY","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An existing technique termed data space adaptation (DSA) transforms EEG data such that the distribution of test and training data are aligned. Decoding accuracy has been shown to improve when transformed data was used for classification instead of the original data. In this study, space transformed data from six subjects were fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) model. The results show that when no adaptation was applied, there was on average a 2.8% improvement in decoding accuracy when CNN was used compared to FBCSP. When DSA was used in conjunction with FBCSP, the majority of the subjects had improved decoding accuracy. However, DSA together with CNN on average yielded a lower decoding accuracy compared to CNN alone. Hence the results suggest that when decoding non-stationary EEG data for motor imagery, DSA should be used only in conjunction with FBCSP, but not when CNN is used as a decoding model.","2641-3604","978-1-7281-0848-3","10.1109/BHI.2019.8834564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8834564","","Decoding;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Testing;Adaptation models;Brain-computer interfaces;Data models","","1","","8","IEEE","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BCI systems based on fine MI can provide an intuitive control pathway of the outer device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used modality for MI due to its high temporal resolution and portability. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has high spatial and temporal resolution, which has received more and more attention. This study designed four kinds of MI tasks of different joints from the same upper limb, including finger, wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints, and additionally added a resting task. The EEG and MEG signals of eight subjects were acquired synchronously. Analysis was conducted on the EEG and MEG data to find the time, time-frequency, and spatial difference between MI tasks of different joints from the same limb. The induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) in EEG signals at the electrode position of the left motor area are more broad and stronger in the alpha frequency band than that in MEG signals during fine MI tasks. From the topographical distribution, different MI tasks affects the area and intensity of the activated area, and topographical distribution of MEG signals in different MI tasks are more discriminative than that of EEG signals. Moreover, the analysis of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) showed that significant negative potentials were detected near the onset of the motor imagery events and there is a significant difference in temporal dimension between magnetoencephalogram and electroencephalogram signals. The work implies that there exist the separable differences between EEG and MEG during fine MI tasks, which can be utilized to build a multimodal classification method for fine MI-BCI systems.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782038","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782038","BCI;MI;MEG;EEG;Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP);MRCP","Wrist;Electrodes;Time-frequency analysis;Electric potential;Shoulder;Motors;Electroencephalography;Spatial resolution;Elbow;Signal resolution","Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Electroencephalography;Male;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Adult;Movement;Imagination;Female;Extremities","","","14","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. Methods: We extend previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. Results: We report an increase of up to 18.6% for individual task classification and 12.7% for overall classification using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based method.

The permutation-based XAI method is first applied for the reliable explanation of the 3D-EEGNet. Next, to find a faster XAI method for spatio-temporal explanation, we design a novel technique based on the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) for selecting the best among a few saliency-based methods due to their higher time complexity than the permutation-based method. Among the saliency-based methods, DeepLIFT was selected because the NDCG scores indicated its results are the most similar to the permutation-based results.

In view of the brain electrical signal decoding error, an experimental paradigm for simultaneous acquisition of spontaneous EEG and evoked EEG was designed, where the subjects generated the error-related potentials (ErrP) based on the decoded feedback of motor imagery EEG. We analyzed the EEG signal two times. The motor imagery EEG, which was the component of the EEG signal, was analyzed at the first time analysis. We classified the motor imagery EEG signal of left and right hand, then analyzed the classification method quantitatively using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AVC). Although the EEG signal were influenced greatly by the individual difference, the AVC values can still reach more than 0.7. Meanwhile, the frequency domain characteristics were analyzed. The activation brain regions of the left-right hand motor imagery are mainly concentrated in the area of the perceptual motor cortex where is responsible for hand motion, but they will also be influenced by the artifacts of the surrounding channels. In the second time analysis, the ErrP was extracted and discussed.

However, current MI approaches are lack of MSFDA for considering different sources’ importance, which may lead to negative transfer. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage MSFDA framework, namely Privacy-preserving Attention-Weighted domain adaptation (PAW), which is the first to emphasize different source importance in EEG MI by identifying crucial features across subjects and sessions. A domain discriminator is designed to find robust features within sessions in the training phase. In the adaptation phase, an attention weighted module determines the source importance, and a balanced confident set policy mitigates noise and imbalance samples. PAW delivers excellent performance via empirical evaluations on several public datasets. In particular, its adaptation phase is applicable across MSFDA scenarios, highlighting its broad application values.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447934","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10447934","Motor imagery;Weighted multi-source;Privacy-preserving;Unsupervised domain adaptation","Training;Adaptation models;Data privacy;Signal processing;Motors;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","1","","18","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, optimizing the EEG channel combinations is another key issue that substantially affects the SMR feature representations. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to find channels that record important characteristics of MI, most of them select channels in a cumbersome way with low computational efficiency, thereby limiting the practicality of MI-based BCI systems. In this study, we propose the multi-scale optimization (MSO) of spatial patterns, optimizing filter bands over multiple channel sets within CSPs to further improve the performance of MI-based BCI. Specifically, several channel subsets are first heuristically predefined, and then raw EEG data specific to each of these subsets bandpass-filtered at the overlap between a set of filter bands. Further, instead of solving learning problems for each channel subset independently, we propose a multi-view learning based sparse optimization to jointly extract robust CSP features with  $L_{2,1}$ -norm regularization, aiming to capture the shared salient information across multiple related spatial patterns for enhanced classification performance. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained on these optimized EEG features for accurate recognition of MI tasks. Experimental results on three public EEG datasets validate the effectiveness of MSO compared to several other competing methods and their variants. These superior experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSO method has promising potential in MI-based BCIs.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.3040984","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073087,61673124); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019B010154002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272754","Brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);common spatial pattern (CSP);multi-view learning","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Optimization;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Support vector machines;Data mining","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machine","28","","64","IEEE","27 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of imagination of a right hand and right foot movement is considered. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is used to estimate the spatial filters for the multi-channel EEG data. The spatial filters lead to weighting of the channel/electrodes according to their variance in discriminating the two tasks performed. Channels with the largest variance are considered as significant channels. A two-fold classification method using support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the test signal into right hand movement and right foot movement.

In this work, a method for the detection of the MI events using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is proposed. Data from thirteen random subjects from a publicly available dataset was utilized. Firstly, the EEG signals were preprocessed and then a combination of time domain and frequency domain features were extracted from the signals. The number of features was reduced and selected using a minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (MRMR) algorithm and forward feature selection.

Nevertheless, existing motor imagery classification algorithms do not always achieve good performances because of the noisy and non-stationary nature of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability. Thus, current EEG BCI takes a considerable upfront toll on patients, who have to submit to lengthy training sessions before even being able to use the BCI.

Feature extraction (FE) is a key to improving the performance of EEG MI decoding. Existing FE methods usually extract single-domain features such as spatial, frequency features, or dual-domain features such as time–frequency features. However, the multidomains features which describe the intent more comprehensively are not simultaneously extracted. Therefore, inspired by short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and common spatial pattern (CSP) FE methods, a frequency-spatial-temporal multidomain (FSTMD) FE method is proposed. To solve the problem of the high dimensions of the FSTMD features, a feature selection (FS) method is designed. In the proposed FSTMD FE process, the STFT is employed to extract the time–frequency domain features first. Then, the time–frequency features of each channel are cascaded. After that, the cascaded features are divided according to time segments. At last, the covariance transform is performed for each time segment. Since the proposed features have a one-to-one correspondence with frequency, channel, and time, the extracted features have good interpretability. The proposed FS method selects the features in the frequency-spatial domain of each time segment based on mutual information and correlation metrics first and then selects the key time segment based on clustering with outlier removal.

In BCI systems, the paradigm of motor imagery has been used to generate patterns to identify the user's intention. However, the study of techniques that allow the correct identification and classification of such intention is still a challenge due to the low performance of algorithms for rehabilitation engineering applications. This study addresses the problem of binary identification of left and right-hand opening and closing motor imagery tasks. A method called Power-Based Connectivity (PBC) is proposed that correlates two reference channels in the central cortex ($C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$) with other channels located in the central area of the brain. The methods were evaluated using an EEG dataset of six subjects with no previous experience in BCI systems built at the Antonio Nariño University. The method was compared with a standard feature extraction method based on Power Spectral Density (PSD). It was used for evaluation accuracy and cohen's Kappa coefficients metrics. Maximum accuracy and cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.7733 and 0.5488, respectively, were obtained using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. Finally, the proposed method was superior in performance and presents significant results in the alpha $(\alpha)$ frequency band and the combination of alpha $(\alpha)$ and beta $(\beta)$.

However, EEG signals exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to various artifacts originating from other physiological sources. To enhance the classification performance of motor imagery tasks by increasing the SNR of EEG signals, several signal decomposition approaches have been proposed. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has shown promising results in extracting EEG components associated with motor imagery tasks more effectively than traditional linear decomposition algorithms such as Fourier and wavelet methods. Nevertheless, the EMD-based algorithm suffers from a significant challenge known as mode mixing, where frequency components intertwine with the intrinsic mode functions obtained through EMD. This issue severely hampers the accuracy of motor imagery classification. Despite numerous algorithms proposed, mode mixing remains a persistent issue. In this paper, we propose the Deep-EMD algorithm, a deep neural network-based approach to mode mixing problem. We employ two datasets to compare the motor imagery classification and mode mixing improvement achieved by the conventional EMD algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Deep-EMD algorithm effectively mitigates the mode mixing problem in decomposed EEG components, leading to improved motor imagery classification performance.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3432102","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:RS-2022-00165231); Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) through the Development of Quantitative Emotion-Sensibility Evaluation Model of Non-Face-To-Face Environment Users and Commercialization of Interactive Digital Contents Application(grant numbers:RS-2023-00229800); Research Grant of Kwangwoon University, in 2024; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10606308","Brain-computer interface (BCI);deep neural networks;empirical mode decomposition;motor imagery (MI)","Electroencephalography;Motors;Training;Noise;Gaussian noise;Empirical mode decomposition;Signal to noise ratio","Humans;Electroencephalography;Imagination;Algorithms;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Neural Networks, Computer;Deep Learning;Artifacts;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","1","","55","CCBY","22 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we propose a novel two-way few-shot network able to efficiently learn how to learn representative features of unseen subject categories and classify them with limited MI EEG data. The pipeline includes an embedding module that learns feature representations from a set of signals, a temporal-attention module to emphasize important temporal features, an aggregation-attention module for key support signal discovery, and a relation module for final classification based on relation scores between a support set and a query signal. In addition to the unified learning of feature similarity and a few-shot classifier, our method can emphasize informative features in support data relevant to the query, which generalizes better on unseen subjects. Furthermore, we propose to fine-tune the model before testing by arbitrarily sampling a query signal from the provided support set to adapt to the distribution of the unseen subject.

As an essential step in decoding, feature extraction usually extracts single-domain features, such as spatial and frequency features, or dual-domain features, such as time-frequency features. However, the multidomain features that describe the intent more comprehensively are not simultaneously acquired. Therefore, we propose a frequency-space–time (FST) multidomain feature extraction method. In the feature extraction process, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is first used to obtain the time-frequency features of the signal and spliced by channel. The covariance operation is performed for each time segment. For multidomain features, we designed a deep-learning network named FSTA-Net. FSTA-Net mainly consists of a frequency-spatial attention module, a time-domain attention module, and a classification network. The computational logic of the weighted summation performed by the two-attention module aggregates the relevant features of all positions of the acting object. To overcome the overfitting problem during training, a data enhancement method based on time-domain translation is designed. We validated the performance of FST features on the brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Competition IV IIa and IIb datasets.

Current research indicates that motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI-MI) training can assist stroke patients in enhancing motor function and reconstructing neural pathways. Nevertheless, 40% of stroke patients struggle with effective motor imagery (MI), leading to challenges in applying lower limb MI in clinical settings. Electrical stimulation (ES) has demonstrated the ability to induce muscle contractions, generating a kinesthetic illusion that effectively guides subjects in performing MI. However, the existing study lacks clarity regarding the effectiveness of the ES-MI paradigm in improving lower limb MI in stroke patients. To address this gap, we recruited seven stroke patients to participate in an experiment involving the ES-MI enhancement paradigm, aiming to validate its performance in stroke patients. The results revealed that the ES-MI paradigm augmented the activation of the motor cortex in the lower limb and reactivated dormant areas, suggesting that MI training based on the ES-MI paradigm holds promise for enhancing neural remodeling effects in stroke patients. Additionally, the paradigm enhanced the classification accuracy of SVM(+1.17%), KNN(+0.93%), RF(+7.13%), LDA(+5.29%), and EEGNet(+0.96%), indicating potential improvements in the efficiency and quality of human-robot interaction in brain-controlled lower limb rehabilitation robots.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782372","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782372","Enhanced motor imagery;electrical stimulation;stroke rehabilitation;EEG classification","Training;Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Human-robot interaction;Neural pathways;Stroke (medical condition);Motors;Assistive robots;Robot sensing systems;Decoding","Humans;Lower Extremity;Male;Female;Stroke;Middle Aged;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Stroke Rehabilitation;Electric Stimulation;Aged;Motor Cortex;Imagination;Imagery, Psychotherapy","","","18","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), most used in this domain, are constrained by limitations associated with their kernel size and inherently limited receptive fields. This restricts their capacity to fully capture the global spatial and temporal dependencies present in EEG signals, which is crucial for accurate decoding. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel approach: a multi-scale residual network based on the multi-head attention mechanism. This model is designed to overcome the constraints of traditional CNNs by incorporating a multi-head attention layer, four convolutional layers, and a pooling layer, which enable the extraction of global and local features.

We evaluate the performance of our model against several state-of-the-art models currently used in the field. The experimental results indicate that our model performs significantly better than the baseline model, with superior decoding accuracy, and our model is faster and more stable in the convergence of the loss function.

However, calculating distances between SCMs is computationally intensive due to operations like eigenvalue decomposition, and classical optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, cannot be directly applied to Riemannian manifolds, making the computation of the Riemannian mean more complex and reliant on iterative methods or approximations. In this paper, we propose a novel multiclass classification framework that integrates Riemannian geometry and neural networks to mitigate these challenges. The framework comprises two modules: a Riemannian module with multiple branches and a classification module. During training, a fusion loss function is introduced to update the branch corresponding to the true label, while other branches are updated using different loss functions along with the classification module.

Depending on the problem and experimental dataset/protocol, researchers use different classification algorithms to classify motor imagery events. Therefore, the selection of classification algorithms for accurate MI detection is significantly important. This paper attempts to provide a brief comparison of the performance of different classification algorithms for MI detection in EEG data. At first, the EEG data of 30 random subjects were collected from a publicly available dataset. Then a combination of time domain and frequency domain features were extracted from the EEG data. Next, the correlated feature selection (CFS) algorithm was used to rank the features based on the correlation. To further reduce the feature set, forward feature selection (FFS) algorithm that was utilized to find out the significant features. For classification, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), naïve bayes (NB), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were investigated with leave one subject out cross-validation scheme. Finally, the performance of all the classifiers was evaluated using the f1-score. The SVM classifier achieved an average f1-score of 70.26% from 30 subjects' trials. The results suggest that the SVM classifier may perform better than other classifiers. Additionally, the linear kernel of SVM helped to reduce the computational time and complexity of the model. It is expected that the SVM classifier may provide better performance in a wider range of populations.","","978-1-6654-3843-8","10.1109/ACMI53878.2021.9528276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528276","Electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);CFS;classification;f1-score","Support vector machines;Mechatronics;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Neurons;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","3","","18","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we investigate the application of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze EEG signals [2] in an image-like format and classify the corresponding motor activity. The dataset consists of EEG recordings collected from subjects performing various motor tasks or motor imagery. We use preprocessing techniques to remove noise and artifacts and then segment the EEG signal into smaller epochs. These epochs are transformed into an image-like representation suitable for CNN input. Data augmentation is applied to increase the size and diversity of the data set, ensuring robust network training. CNN architectures are designed to capture spatial patterns and hierarchical features present in EEG signals. The network is trained using a suitable loss function and optimization algorithm. Performance evaluation is performed against a separate validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score [4].

However, obtaining a mass of labeled EEG data is often difficult due to the strict requirement of experimental environment and the necessity for highly cooperative subjects, which makes the application of few-shot learning of EEG classification particularly important. Therefore, we propose a method that combines few-shot learning with triplet metric learning, aiming to maintain strong generalization capabilities of the model with limited samples. Firstly, we pretrain a base model using large auxiliary dataset, and then fine-tune it with a small number of labeled samples from the test subjects to obtain a specific model. During the training process, metric learning between anchor samples and positive/negative samples are employed to gradually converge similar samples, creating clearer class boundaries. Then the feature information of the samples is enhanced through an attention mechanism to obtain their essential features. The proposed framework was evaluated using two publicly available datasets and obtained classification accuracies of 68.29% and 84.40%, respectively, representing enhancements of 1.04% and 1.28% over existing state-of-the-art methods.

The goal of this study is to propose a novel decoding method to classify the MI tasks of four joints of the same upper limb and the resting state. EEG signals were collected from 20 participants. A time-distributed attention network (TD-Atten) was proposed to adaptively assign different weights to different classes and frequency bands of the input multiband Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features. The long short-term memory (LSTM) and dense layers were then used to learn sequential information from the reweight features and perform the classification. Our proposed method outperformed other baseline and deep learning-based methods and obtained the accuracies of 46.8% in the 5-class scenario and 53.4% in the 4-class scenario. The visualization results of attention weights indicated that the proposed framework can adaptively pay attention to alpha-band related features in MI tasks, which was consistent with the analysis of brain activation patterns.

Multi-channel electrode montage achieves EEG measurements with high spatial resolution. In previous studies of MI-EEG decoding, the extracted temporal features of multi-channel EEG measurement data were harnessed to recognize different MI-EEG patterns, while spatial features, especially those manifesting the intrinsic connectivity of EEG channels during different MI tasks, has often been overlooked. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal interactive attention network (STIA-Net), which exploits spatial features, temporal features, as well as their interaction, for MI-EEG decoding. Graph convolution is employed for spatial feature manipulation, where functional connectivity with phase locking value (PLV) is involved to establish a graph and hence exhibiting topological structural properties. The temporal features are extracted by dilated temporal convolutions, and spatio-temporal interaction is accomplished via attention mechanism. The STIA-Net utilizes the spatio-temporal feature fusion for ultimate MI-EEG classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STIA-Net performs well on the PhysioNet MI-EEG dataset, with a subject-independent classification accuracy of 83.9%, higher than state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-6654-6972-2","10.1109/ICSPCC55723.2022.9984387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984387","Electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);functional connectivity;graph convolution;attention mechanism","Electrodes;Convolution;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models;Decoding","","2","","22","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MI data is generated when a subject imagines movement of limbs and can be used to aid rehabilitation as well as in autonomous driving scenarios. Thus, classification of MI signals is vital for EEG-based BCI systems. Recently, MI EEG classification techniques using deep learning have shown improved performance over conventional techniques. However, due to inter-subject variability, the scarcity of unseen subject data, and low signal-to-noise ratio, extracting robust features and improving accuracy is still challenging. In this context, we propose a novel two-way few shot network that is able to efficiently learn how to learn representative features of unseen subject categories and how to classify them with limited MI EEG data. The pipeline includes an embedding module that learns feature representations from a set of samples, an attention mechanism for key signal feature discovery, and a relation module for final classification based on relation scores between a support set and a query signal. In addition to the unified learning of feature similarity and a few shot classifier, our method leads to emphasize informative features in support data relevant to the query data, which generalizes better on unseen subjects. For evaluation, we used the BCI competition IV 2b dataset and achieved an 9.3% accuracy improvement in the 20-shot classification task with state-of-the-art performance.

First, a feature-dependent frequency band selection method based on correlation coefficient (FDCC) was proposed to select feature-specific effective bands. Second, a feature fusion method was proposed to fuse different types of candidate features to produce multiple refined sets of decoding features. Finally, an ensemble model using the weighted voting strategy was proposed to make full use of these diverse sets of final features. The results on a public EEG dataset of five fingers motor imagery showed that the DSFE method is effective and achieves the highest decoding accuracy of 50.64%, which is 7.64% higher than existing studies using exactly the same data. The experiments further revealed that both the effective frequency bands of different subjects and the effective frequency bands of different types of features are different in finger motor imagery. Furthermore, compared with two-hand motor imagery, the effective decoding information of finger motor imagery is transferred to the lower frequency.

Three methods are explored: data generation based on time segments, time-frequency segments, and empirical mode decomposition. To compare the methods, the left-hand and right-hand data of nine subjects from the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset are used as experiment material. First, each training trial is preprocessed and divided into smaller components using the selected methods. Second, an artificial trial for one class is created by combining several randomly chosen components from the targeted class. The process is repeated 100 times for each class, resulting in 200 artificial trials in total. Afterwards, a new training dataset combining the original and artificial trials is used for fitting the classifier, which consists of CSP and LDA. The performance of each data generation method is measured based on two parameters: time elapsed for ADG process and classifier accuracy. Overall, ADG based on time segments performed the fastest in terms of decomposition time (0.0255 s) and data construction time (0.1969 s) taken. However, while artificial trials from time segments and time-frequency segments are able to improve classifier accuracy when small training sample is used (73.73% and 75.16% versus 68.45% for 24 original training trials), baseline classifier without artificial trials still performs better with more original training trials.","","978-1-7281-7156-2","10.1109/IBIOMED50285.2020.9487602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9487602","artificial data generation;brain-computer interface;calibration time reduction;motor imagery","Training;Image segmentation;Time-frequency analysis;Empirical mode decomposition;Fitting;Electroencephalography;Time measurement","","","","19","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research on EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has shown that individuals can retain a sense of agency and ownership even when they control virtual arms by imaging the movement but without physically performing it. Here, we investigated (i) if we are more accurate in controlling the movement of a virtual device qualified as part of one’s own body and (ii) to what extent the EEG feature linked to the agency for one’s own body parts and for external device differ. To this aim, participants use an EEGbased BCI to control two virtual arms presented either in a first-person perspective to induce both a sense of ownership and agency over the virtual arms, or in an anatomical incongruent position to retain only the sense of agency. Preliminary data (n=4) showed that there is no difference in the accuracy in controlling the virtual arms in the two conditions, as measured by the EEG decoding algorithm reflecting the motor intention of the user. Crucially, both conditions elicit a sense of agency over the virtual arms, although the sense of ownership was present only in the first-person perspective condition. If confirmed in the remaining participants to be tested (n=34), these results will suggest that the ability of controlling a virtual device is not affected by the sense of ownership felt over it. Therefore, motor control’s accuracy and the subsequent sense of agency are the consequences of the association between an internal volitional signal and the external outcome, bypassing the actual body movements and the sense of body ownership. We provide a unique window into the relation between motor control and the sense of body ownership-findings that have important implications for daily life support of patients using neuroprosthetics.","","978-1-6654-8574-6","10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967507","BCI;Motor Imagery;Virtual Reality;Extended Reality;Body Ownership;EEG;Neurofeedback;Gamification","Performance evaluation;Motor drives;Neuroprostheses;Neural engineering;Imaging;Metrology;Particle measurements","","1","","16","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing deep learning-based methods usually only adopt the constraint of classification loss, which hardly obtains the features with high discrimination and limits the improvement of EEG decoding accuracy. In this paper, a discriminative feature learning strategy is proposed to improve the discrimination of features, which includes the central distance loss (CD-loss), the central vector shift strategy, and the central vector update process. First, the CD-loss is proposed to make the same class of samples converge to the corresponding central vector. Then, the central vector shift strategy extends the distance between different classes of samples in the feature space. Finally, the central vector update process is adopted to avoid the non-convergence of CD-loss and weaken the influence of the initial value of central vectors on the final results. In addition, overfitting is another severe challenge for deep learning-based EEG decoding methods. To deal with this problem, a data augmentation method based on circular translation strategy is proposed to expand the experimental datasets without introducing any extra noise or losing any information of the original data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct some experiments on two public motor imagery EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and 2b dataset), respectively. The comparison with current state-of-the-art methods indicates that our method achieves the highest average accuracy and good stability on the two experimental datasets.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3051958","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52075177); Joint Fund of the Ministry of Education for Equipment Pre-Research(grant numbers:6141A02033124); Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A050505001,2018KZDXM002); Guangzhou Research Foundation(grant numbers:202002030324,201903010028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9327487","Motor imagery electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding;central distance loss (CD-loss);central vector shift;central vector update;circular translation strategy","Electroencephalography;Decoding;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Classification algorithms;Deep learning;Data mining","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination","64","","38","CCBY","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the control methods employed for BMIs, the paradigm of motor imagery is widely used. To achieve this control it is necessary to define an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal decoding algorithm for the extraction of optimal features. The latter is difficult due to the non-stationary character of the EEG signal and the artefacts that can interfere in it. This study focuses on the analysis and processing of EEG signals from two healthy subjects to develop an algorithm for the decoding of motor imagery (MI). As a method for feature extraction, PSD (Power Spectral Density) will be used. For this purpose, the Welch technique, which is an approach measure of the PSD, is applied. This algorithm has been tested for two electrode combinations. In addition, the EEG signals are conditioned by the movement generated in the foot due to an ankle exoskeleton used. This exoskeleton has been designed with a low-cost philosophy and allows dorsiflexion and plantar flexion movements. The result of the MI decoding algorithm for the first combination was an average accuracy value of 68.8% and for the second combination 75%, providing an important baseline for future research in this area.","","979-8-3503-7800-9","10.1109/MetroXRAINE62247.2024.10796712","ERDF; European Social Fund; Generalitat Valenciana; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10796712","Brain-Machine Interface Systems (BMI);Low-Cost Exoskeleton;Electroencephalographic Signals (EEG);Motor Imagery (MI);Neurorehabilitation","Ankle;Philosophical considerations;Exoskeletons;Motors;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Neurorehabilitation;Decoding;Robots","","","","13","IEEE","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EEG-based motor imagery (MI) brain signal is widely utilized in various BCI fields including intelligent healthcare, robot control, and smart homes. Yet, the limited capability of decoding brain signals remains a significant obstacle to BCI techniques expansion. In this study, we describe an architecture known as the dual-branch attention temporal convolutional network (DB-ATCNet) for EEG-based MI classification. DB-ATCNet improves MI classification performance with relatively fewer parameters by utilizing a dual-branch convolutional network and channel attention. The DB-ATCNet model consists of two primary modules: attention dual-branch convolution (ADBC) and attention temporal fusion convolution (ATFC). The ADBC module utilizes a dual-branch convolutional network to extract low-level MI-EEG features and incorporates channel attention to improve spatial feature extraction. ATFC employs sliding windows with self-attention to obtain the high-level temporal features, and utilizes feature fusion strategies to minimize information loss. The DB-ATCNet achieved subject-independent accuracies of 87.33% and 69.58% in two-class and four-class classification tasks, respectively, on the PhysioNet dataset. On the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 71.34% and 87.54% for subject-independent and subject-dependent evaluations, respectively, surpassing existing methods.

Therefore, designing a single-limb, multi-category motor imagery (MI) paradigm and effectively decoding it is one of the important research directions in the future development of MI-BCI. Furthermore, one of the major challenges in MI-BCI is the difficulty of classifying brain activity across different individuals. In this article, the transfer data learning network (TDLNet) is proposed to achieve the cross-subject intention recognition for multiclass upper limb motor imagery. In TDLNet, the Transfer Data Module (TDM) is used to process cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in groups and then fuse cross-subject channel features through two one-dimensional convolutions. The Residual Attention Mechanism Module (RAMM) assigns weights to each EEG signal channel and dynamically focuses on the EEG signal channels most relevant to a specific task. Additionally, a feature visualization algorithm based on occlusion signal frequency is proposed to qualitatively analyze the proposed TDLNet. The experimental results show that TDLNet achieves the best classification results on two datasets compared to CNN-based reference methods and transfer learning method. In the 6-class scenario, TDLNet obtained an accuracy of 65%±0.05 on the UML6 dataset and 63%±0.06 on the GRAZ dataset.

In this study, two sliding window techniques are proposed to enhance the binary classification of MI. The first one calculates the longest consecutive repetition (LCR) of the sequence of prediction of all the sliding windows and is named SW-LCR. The second calculates the mode of the sequence of prediction of all the sliding windows and is named SW-Mode. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is used for extracting features with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) used for classification of each time window. Both the SW-LCR and SW-Mode are applied on publicly available BCI Competition IV-2a data set of healthy individuals and on a stroke patients’ data set. Compared with the existing state of the art, the SW-LCR performed better in the case of healthy individuals and SW-Mode performed better on stroke patients’ data set for left- versus right-hand MI with lower standard deviation. For both the data sets, the classification accuracy (CA) was approximately 80% and kappa ( $\kappa $ ) was 0.6. The results show that the sliding window-based prediction of MI using SW-LCR and SW-Mode is robust against intertrial and intersession inconsistencies in the time of activation within a trial and thus can lead to a reliable performance in a neurorehabilitative BCI setting.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3051996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326392","Brain-computer interface (BCI);common spatial patterns (CSPs);electroencephalography (EEG);linear discriminant analysis (LDA);motor imagery (MI);neurorehabilitation","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Stroke (medical condition);Rhythm;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Training","","165","","41","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EEG is a low-cost brain cognition and imaging technique with high temporal resolutions that can be used to extract features from Motor Imagery tasks. The common spatial pattern (CSP) and its optimized algorithms are effective methods for discriminating and classifying EEG Signals. To classify motor imagery tasks in EEG signals, we must use the CSP algorithm to extract features and discriminate spatial patterns associated with movement activities in two-class motor imagery signals. Furthermore, owing to the amount of noise in EEG signals and the limited number of trials per subject, along with a penalty term in the denominator of the CSP cost function, we may optimize the conventional CSP algorithm. In this study, due to differences in each subject’s neural activities, we employed transfer learning which used the information for other subjects to regulate features of the subject. Additionally, BCI Competition III dataset IVa was analyzed. Furthermore, this study presents the optimized Filter Bank Regularized CSP algorithm with Transfer Learning to perform the classification of the electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery signals. Moreover, to compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the conventional CSP and the proposed optimized CSP have been weighed, and results for both methods are presented. The results at the end explain that the classification with 10-fold cross-validation in comparison with that of the proposed method achieves approximately 15% and 21% higher accuracy against the R-CSP and conventional CSP, respectively.","2642-9527","978-1-6654-8087-1","10.1109/ICEE55646.2022.9827057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827057","Brain-Computer-Interface;BCI;EEG;Motor Imagery;FBRCSP;Common Spatial Pattern","Transfer learning;Neural activity;Filter banks;Imaging;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms","","4","","19","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This in turn can enable individuals who are suffering from transradial amputations to better control prosthetic hands and to perform various dexterous hand tasks. In particular, we present a novel three-stage framework for decoding MI tasks of the same hand. The three stages of the proposed framework are the input, feature extraction, and classification stages. At the input stage, we employ a quadratic time-frequency distribution (QTFD) to analyze the EEG signals in the joint time-frequency domain. The use of a QTFD enables to transform the EEG signals into a set of two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency images (TFIs) that describe the distribution of the energy encapsulated within the EEG signals in terms of the time, frequency, and electrode position. At the feature extraction stage, we design a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can automatically analyze and extract salient features from the TFIs created at the input stage. Finally, the features obtained at the feature extraction stage are passed to the classification stage to assign each input TFI to one of the eleven MI tasks that are considered in the current study. The performance of our proposed framework is evaluated using EEG signals that were acquired from eighteen able-bodied subjects and four transradial amputated subjects while performing eleven MI tasks within the same hand. The average classification accuracies obtained for the able-bodied and transradial amputated subjects are 73.7% and 72.8%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed framework yields 14.5% and 11.2% improvements over the results obtained for the able-bodied and transradial amputated subjects, respectively, using conventional QTFD-based handcrafted features and a multi-class support vector machine classifier.

Motor imagery (MI), the mental rehearsal of movements, has been studied extensively in BCIs as a means of decoding user intent from neural activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings provide a non-invasive interface for monitoring MI by detecting changes in brain activation. Accurately classifying MI from EEG signals is essential for developing practical MI-based BCIs. However, existing machine learning techniques require extensive preprocessing and handcrafted feature engineering, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for end-to-end MI classification from raw EEG signals without manual feature extraction. Specifically, we employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to automatically learn spatiotemporal features from the EEG data. The extracted features are then fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to perform classification. We demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves significantly higher accuracy in classifying right-hand and foot MI compared to conventional machine learning classifiers. Our results highlight the potential of deep learning to advance MI-based BCIs by learning highly complex representations of EEG signals in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed LSTM-MLP model thus represents a promising step towards more sophisticated BCIs that can translate raw neural data into control signals without the need for handcrafted features.","2325-9418","979-8-3503-0559-3","10.1109/INDICON59947.2023.10440899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10440899","Motor Imagery (MI);Electroencephalogram (EEG);Long Short Term Memory (LSTM);Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)","Deep learning;Motors;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","","","19","IEEE","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BCI based on motor imagery (MI) can distinguish activation of specific brain regions by decoding EEG signals and then applying them to different situations. Because the activation regions of the brain are specific, using all EEG channels for classification is redundant and may lead to feature confusion and inconvenience for users when applying EEG. Current EEG channel selection methods focus primarily on a single subject and require the data from the subject to generate the chosen channel, which is inconvenient on the application side to determine suitable channels for new subjects. Therefore, this study introduces a novel method for generalized EEG channel selection. Two datasets are used: the BCI competition IV 2a dataset for generating generalized EEG channels and the OpenBMI dataset for validation by numerous subjects. First, the signals from each channel are fed into EEG-Net for classification and ranked by loss to generate optimal EEG channels. Then, the methods of ranking and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II are used to find different combinations of optimal potential differences. Finally, the generalized EEG channels are generated and validated by EEG-Net again. The validation results show that 88.5% of the subjects can be well-classified in one session, including MI-illiteracy, defined by the dataset. The average accuracy is 77.7% and 79.26% in Sessions 1 and 2, using the average channel number around 5, instead of channels from the motor cortex region or all placed EEG channels.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3313236","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:NSTC- 11-2221-E-A49-168-MY3,110-2221-E-A49-121-MY2,110-2221-E-224-026,110-2634-F-007-027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10251120","Channel selection;deep learning;EEG-Net;electroencephalography (EEG);generalized optimal EEG channels;lateralized readiness potential (LRP);motor imagery (MI);non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II algorithm;optimization","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Sensors;Electric potential;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Electrodes","","4","","47","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current research predominantly concentrates on the bilateral limbs paradigm and decoding, but the use scenarios for stroke rehabilitation are typically for unilateral upper limbs. There is a significant challenge to decoding unilateral MI of multitasks due to the overlapped spatial neural activities of the tasks. This study aims to formulate a novel MI-BCI experimental paradigm for unilateral limbs with multitasks. The paradigm encompasses four imagined movement directions: top-bottom, left-right, top right-bottom left, and top left-bottom right. Forty-six healthy subjects participated in this experiment. Commonly used machine learning techniques, such as FBCSP, EEGNet, deepConvNet, and FBCNet, were employed for evaluation. To improve decoding accuracy, we propose an MVCA method that introduces temporal convolution and attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal features from multiple perspectives. With the MVCA model, we have achieved 40.6% and 64.89% classification accuracies for the four-class and two-class scenarios (top right-bottom left and top left-bottom right), respectively. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that motor imagery of multiple directions in unilateral limbs can be decoded. In particular, decoding two directions, right top to left bottom and left top to right bottom, provides the best accuracy, which sheds light on future studies. This study advances the development of the MI-BCI paradigm, offering preliminary evidence for the feasibility of decoding multiple directional information from EEG.

This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments.

Because MI-based BCI offers a high degree of freedom, it helps people with motor disabilities communicate with the device by performing a sequence of MI tasks. Several techniques are being developed to improve the classification performance of the MI signals used in BCI. Most researches focused on improving methods for feature extraction and selection, but relied on linear classifiers for class prediction. In this paper, we investigate the use of ensemble learning methods to improve classification accuracy in a BCI paradigm based on 2-class MIs.

Furthermore, high dimensional EEG montages introduce huge computational burden due to excessive number of channels involved. Two experimental, i.e., inter-session and inter-subject, variabilities of EEG dynamics during motor imagery (MI) tasks are investigated in this paper. In particular, the effect on the performance of the BCIs due to day-to-day variability in EEG dynamics during the alterations in cognitive stages is explored. In addition, the inter-subject BCIs feasibility between cortically synchronized and desynchronized subject pairs on pairwise performance associativity is further examined. Moreover, the consequences of integrating spatial brain dynamics of varying the number of channels - from specific regions of the brain - are also discussed in case of both the contexts. The proposed approach is validated on real BCI data set containing EEG data from four classes of MI tasks, i.e., left/right hand, both feet, and tongue, subjected prior to a preprocessing of three different spatial filtering techniques. Experimental results have shown that a maximum classification accuracy of around 58% was achieved for the inter-subject experimental case, whereas a 31% deviation was noticed in the classification accuracies across two sessions during the inter-session experimental case.

To address these problems, this paper proposes a debiased domain adaptation framework with minimum class confusion to learn unbiased representations in motor imagery tasks. Specially, unlike the feature alignment and adversarial training methods, we explore the class predictions for domain adaptation, applying the minimum class confusion loss criterion in the target domain to reduce inter-class confusion. This approach aims to alleviate the bias issues inherent in classifiers trained on the source domain for making predictions in the target domain, achieving class-level alignment. Consequently, it enhances the model’s ability to adapt to the data distribution of the target domain.

This study proposes a skip connection generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation model to generate MI EEG samples, to expand the amount of the samples for the EEG decoding. The SGD utilizes independent component analysis (ICAs) to extract EEG background noise and to retain more biological information for the GAN and then employs a skip connection and multihead attention to integrate high- and low-level EEG features in the generator. Subsequently, the SGD adopts a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to discriminate between samples. The brain-computer interface (BCI) Competition IV-2a dataset is used to validate the SGD on four-class MI EEG decoding. The results show that the SGD can retain high accuracies (best accuracy: 86.15%,  $p =0.034$ ) under different ratios of generated MI EEG samples, implying that the skip connection and multihead attention are helpful for reconstructing the temporal and spatial features of MI EEG by ablation experiment.

FNNs represent a neural network architecture tailored to smooth processes, and as such have been applied to EEG data classification recently. The paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline encompassing data acquisition, synchronization, pre-processing, training of FNNs, and real-time inference to enable the seamless integration of FNNs into real-world BCI applications. For the first time, FNNs are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline and serve for live inference outside a strict laboratory setting. In pursuit of a more accessible electroencephalography (EEG) artificial intelligence (AI) training scenario, the paper introduces a self-paced environment for auto-labeling EEG data. A custom-designed Pong game serves as the training task and enables subjects to engage in MI/ME tasks while receiving immediate visual feedback. To automate the labeling process of the recorded EEG data, the movements of both arms are captured with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and analyzed through gesture recognition. This novel training framework contributes to more natural and engaging data collection and reduces pre-processing for model training. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, the paper compares the performance of FNN and EEGNet in the self-paced MI/ME tasks. The comparative analysis addresses factors such as classification accuracy, real-time processing speed, and power consumption. Furthermore, the study explores various auto-labeling methods within the self-paced environment, analyzing their impact on the classification performances of both architectures. By evaluating these labeling methods, this work addresses the challenge of accurate and efficient EEG data labeling, crucial for training robust models for prediction of time critical events. The proposed pipeline and experimental design culminate in a full-scale evaluation of the FNN-based classification system to demonstrate its efficacy in real-time MI/ME tasks. The paper’s contributions not only establish FNNs as a potent tool for EEG classification but also provide valuable insights into enhancing the accessibility, usability, and performance of EEG-based AI systems in real-world applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3569932","Ministry of Economics, Innovation, Digitization and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia(grant numbers:GE-2-2-023,IT-2-2-023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11004003","auto labeling;brain-computer interface (BCI);BCI-illiteracy;electroencephalography (EEG);functional neural network (FNN);gamification;inertial measurement unit (IMU);motor execution (ME);motor imagery (MI)","Games;Electroencephalography;Motors;Training;Biological neural networks;Accuracy;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Labeling;Brain modeling","","","","","CCBYNCND","14 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous studies have suggested that MI induces partly subject-specific EEG activation patterns, suggesting that individualized classification models should be created. However, due to fatigue of the user, only a limited number of samples can be recorded and, for EEG recordings, each sample is often composed of a large number of features. This combination leads to an undesirable input data set for classification. In order to overcome this constraint, we propose a new methodology to create and select features from the EEG signal in two steps. First, the input data is divided into different windows to reduce the cardinality of the input. Secondly, a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm is used to select relevant features using a novel fitness function which combines the data reduction with a correlation feature selection measure. The methodology has been tested on EEG oscillatory activity recorded from 6 healthy volunteers while they performed an MI task. Results have successfully proven that a classification above 75% can be obtained in a restrictive amount of time (0.02 s), reducing the number of features by almost 90%.","","978-1-7281-2153-6","10.1109/CEC.2019.8789948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789948","Motor Imagery;EEG Signal;Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm","Electroencephalography;Genetic algorithms;Task analysis;Sociology;Statistics;Feature extraction;Training","","3","","30","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Long-term calibration can be used to improve EEG-based performance, but which will cause low efficiency and reduce practicality. To overcome the limitation, data from other subjects can be used for transfer learning to reduce calibration time. Therefore, a calibration-free transfer learning method for EEG-based cross-subject MI classification is proposed in this paper. On one hand, Euclidean alignment and Riemannian alignment are introduced to reduce domain differences. On the other hand, the similarity is calculated by Multiple Kernel-Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) to select appropriate source domain samples, which is followed by domain adversarial training of neural network (DANN) for the final model construction. In order to achieve calibration-free, the new subjects' resting-state data was used only. Extensive experiments were conducted on BCI competition IV dataset 2a.

The model is termed as a fixed calibration model. Progressive adaptive models can also be built by using data not only from calibration session, but also from available rehabilitation sessions. It was reported that the progressive adaptive model yielded significant improved MI detection compared to the fixed model in a retrospective clinical study. In this work, we deploy the progressive adaptation model in a BCI-based stroke rehabilitation system and bring it online. We dub this system nBETTER (Neurostyle Brain Exercise Therapy Towards Enhanced Recovery). A clinical trial using the nBETTER system was conducted to evaluate the performance of 11 stroke patients who underwent a calibration session followed by 18 rehabilitation sessions over 6 weeks. We conduct retrospective analysis to compare the performance of various modeling strategies: the fixed calibration model, the online progressive adaptation model and a light-weight adaptation model, where the second one is generated online by nBETTER system and the other two models are obtained retrospectively.

However, it is still challenging to train CNNs on multiple subjects' EEG without decreasing individual performance. This is known as the negative transfer problem, i.e. learning from dissimilar distributions causes CNNs to misrepresent each of them instead of learning a richer representation. As a result, CNNs cannot directly use multiple subjects' EEG to enhance model performance directly. To address this problem, we extend deep transfer learning techniques to the EEG multi-subject training case. We propose a multi-branch deep transfer network, the Separate-Common-Separate Network (SCSN) based on splitting the network's feature extractors for individual subjects. We also explore the possibility of applying Maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD) to the SCSN (SCSN-MMD) to better align distributions of features from individual feature extractors. The proposed network is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (BCICIV2a dataset) and our online recorded dataset. Results show that the proposed SCSN (81.8%, 53.2%) and SCSN-MMD (81.8%, 54.8%) outperformed the benchmark CNN (73.4%, 48.8%) on both datasets using multiple subjects.

Automatic classifier tuning seems to be an essential component in real-time BCI systems which makes the interface more reliable and easy to use and may offer the optimum configuration of classifier. This paper investigates the robustness of Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) to classify multi-class self-paced motor imagery (MI) temporal features while tuning the hyperparameters automatically. MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were preprocessed and segmented into non-overlapped distinctive time slots. Five different temporal features were extracted to characterize various properties of three Mis. An extended version of LS-SVM was employed for feature classification while the kernel model parameters were tuned by means of two optimization techniques, Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) followed by Simplex. LS-SVM parameters were evaluated and selected through leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) cost function. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated and compared to three widely used classifiers. The results indicated the high potential of LS-SVM to classify different Mis by obtaining the average classification accuracy 89.88±8.00 when using Sign Slop Changes (SSC) features. However, this LS-SVM performed slowly due to its additional steps for automatic model parameter tuning. In the comparative study, it was shown that each classifier behaved differently when various features were served; however, KNN outperformed others in both terms of classification accuracy and speed.","","978-1-4799-6483-3","10.1109/IFESS.2014.7036749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036749","Self-paced motor imagery;EEG temporal features;least-square support vector machine;classification;BCL","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Tuning;Training;Kernel","","4","","12","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By comparison, to fit EEG electrodes on the forehead area is much easier because there is no hair on it. If correlations of the EEGs generated from the forehead area are high with respect to EEGs from the sensorimotor area, it is then possible to achieve relatively high classification accuracy in motor imagery tasks just using EEG from forehead channels. In this way, it will help to make the procedure of motor imagery tasks much easier and convenient. Because correlation coefficients is often used to measure the similarity of two signals, it is necessary to study whether there is a high correlation between forehead channels' EEG and EEG from sensorimotor area during MI(motor imagery) tasks. In this paper, EEG data from three subjects were used in the tests. Firstly, a test was conducted on the correlation between EEGs from forehead 8(Fp1-Af8) channels and EEGs from the sensorimotor area channel C3, C4 during the MI tasks. The correlation is calculated with respect to ERP (event-related-potential), spectral power between 6-25 Hz, and ERSP (event-related-spectral-perturbation) at Alpha rhythms 8-12 Hz. The results of the correlation tests are mostly above 70%. In particular, for subject Sl1, the correlation coefficient of ERSP between forehead channels and C3, C4 are as high as 0.9 during the left hand movement imagery trials. Secondly, we did a test on the classification of imagined left/right hand movement tasks using EEGs from 8 electrodes in the forehead. Classification results show that the accuracy of the forehead 8 channels' EEGs are as high as 81% for subject Sk6 comparing to 90% using 29 channels' EEG signal neighboring to C3, C4. For subject Sk3 and subject Sl1, the accuracies are 65% and 79% comparing to 80% and 83% using EEG signals from 29 channels neighboring to C3, C4. So there are high correlation between EEGs from the forehead area and EEGs from the sensorimotor area. That is to say, we can use EEGs from forehead in some situations, such as classification of left/right imagery, because they are much easier to measure than EEG form the sensorimotor area. This will make BCI system more portable and more convenient to use.","","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380418","","Electroencephalography;Forehead;Testing;Electrodes;Scalp;Hair;Area measurement;Head;Enterprise resource planning;Rhythm","","12","2","17","IEEE","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are eight reference clusters whose locations have been calculated based on the precise coordinates of a copious amount of brain dipoles acquired from a large number of users performing MI tasks. In this method, called 8 Ref-Clusters, a kind of Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm along with the DIPFIT plugin of the EEGLAB platform take on a decisive role. These eight clusters demonstrate which dipoles are brain sources and which ones are artifacts to eliminate. In the case of improving the performance of a system for a particular subject, we defined a specific threshold that could alter the size of clusters in three dimensions. The elaborate threshold pointed out above is unquestionably user-dependent. Having made a comparison between results before and after applying the 8-Ref-Clusters on the BCI-Competition IV 2a datasets, the average performance increased by roughly 4% which is promising when the datasets used in these evaluations had been filtered, between 8 and 30 Hz, only before applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Making a comparison between the results of the proposed method and those of other CSP-based methods shows that applying the proposed artifact removal only before CSP can significantly enhance the performance of the system at about 15.6%, in the case of the mCSP method. All in all, the proposed artifact removal method is a semi-automatic method that is computationally fast and able to detect the various types of artifacts like a heartbeat, muscle and head movements, eye blink, line noise, and so on.","","979-8-3503-9717-8","10.1109/ICBME57741.2022.10052870","Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(grant numbers:2400208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052870","BSS;DIPFIT Plug-in;EEG;ICA;Motor Imagery;Semi-Automatic EEG Artifact Removal","Training;Head;Heart beat;System performance;Independent component analysis;Muscles;Lead","","","","18","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These models produce excellent results but present the drawback of a considerable high processing time, a critical limitation for its application on real Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems. Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms can be an alternative wrapper approach for the feature selection task, given that they outperform classical Evolutionary Algorithms in the exploration and exploitation of the search space, obtaining the global solution much faster.

We propose a cross-channel specific-mutual feature transfer learning (CCSM-FT) network model to solve this problem. The multibranch network extracts the specific and mutual features of brain’s multiregion signals. Effective training tricks are used to maximize the distinction between the two kinds of features. Suitable training tricks can also improve the effectiveness of the algorithm compared with novel models. Finally, we transfer two kinds of features to explore the potential of mutual and specific features to enhance the expressive power of the feature and use the auxiliary set to improve identification performance. The experimental results show that the network has a better classification effect in the BCI Competition IV-2a and the HGD datasets.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3269512","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61733003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130804","Brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);motor imagery (MI);training tricks;transfer learning","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Training;Electrodes;Decoding;Brain modeling;Neurons","Humans;Electroencephalography;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Imagination;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Brain;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Deep Learning;Machine Learning","4","","52","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our research, we adhere to the standard MI-based BCI workflow, but our methodology introduces an optimized and better model for classifying EEG data. To reduce the data used for the classification, we extracted five features, spanning both frequency and wavelet domain features, from the EEG signals. These features are then dimensionally reduced by passing through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and the best two features have been selected for classification. This Ensemble classifier model is applied to the best two features that have been extracted. This result is being compared with existing traditional Machine Learning algorithms - Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR).

The set of relevant and discriminative features plays an important role in the classification scheme. This paper presents a supervised approach to select discriminative features for the enhancement of MI classification using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The dimension of multiband feature space is reduced using the feature selection method. Each trial of the multichannel EEG signal representing MI tasks is decomposed into a finite set of narrowband signals. The common spatial pattern-based features are extracted from each subband. The features obtained from the multiple subbands are combined to derive a high-dimensional feature vector. The neighborhood component analysis-based feature selection method is implemented to select the features that are relevant in performing an accurate classification. It is a nearest-neighbor-based approach to learn the feature weights with regularization by maximizing the average leave-one-out classification accuracy over the labeled training data. The selected features are used to train the support vector machine for classification. The features relatively irrelevant to the classification task are discarded, yielding a reduction of feature dimension. The evaluation of the proposed method is performed using BCI Competition III dataset 4a and IV dataset 2b.

Despite the ease of data recording, the labeling of the data needs expert knowledge, which is expensive. Also, the data collected from the same subjects in different sessions are prone to varying distribution, making the cross-session data classification more challenging. Supervised learning has been widely used for EEG signal analysis, but its performance is highly dependent on a vast amount of annotated data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proven to be a highly effective technique that allows deep learning architectures to learn general features from unlabelled data without needing an extensive amount of labeled data. This paper proposes a self-supervised contrastive learning method of cross-session based EEG data for motor imagery classification. The pretext task of signal transformations has been used to train the network during the training phase to reduce the distance between the similar transformation pairs and maximize the distance between the dissimilar transformation pairs generated from the EEG signals. It helps the network learn generalized features of cross-session EEG signals with the help of representation learning and in the absence of labeled data. The diverse nature of cross-session EEG data leads the network toward learning more generalized features. The performance of the proposed model upon pretraining on the BCI-IV 2a dataset using self-supervised contrastive learning and the fine-tuning on the same dataset using supervised learning gives the average accuracy of 50.81% and performed significantly better than the compared supervised learning-based methods.","2831-7475","978-1-6654-9062-7","10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956291","","Training;Representation learning;Supervised learning;Neural networks;Self-supervised learning;Electroencephalography;Recording","","8","","45","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To address this issue, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. To our knowledge, it is the first work that an end-to-end framework is proposed to achieve cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2025.3532480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10848200","motor imagery (MI);electroencephalography (EEG);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);spatial cross-modal generation (SCG);multi-scale temporal representation (MTR)","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Noise reduction;Correlation;Training;Diffusion processes;Motors;Feature extraction;Convolution","","","","","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This technology is expected to establish rehabilitation for people with disabilities and support wheelchair operations among other benefits. Usually, it is difficult to construct a general-purpose classification model by machine learning because of the large individual differences in MI-BCI. However, the advances in deep learning have increased the classification accuracy of general-purpose learning. Further, when deep learning is used to classify MI, a large amount of data is required for training, which increases the burden on the user. Fine-tuning, which achieves high classification accuracy by relearning and fine-tuning the weights of previously learned models, can be used to reduce the amount of data required for training. In this study, fine-tuning was performed on EEGNet, a deep learning model that can classify MI with high accuracy, using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. Further, the required amount of training data and classification accuracy were optimized. Fine-tuning was performed using the pre-training results of eight subjects other than the target subject for training (subject transfer). The target subject displayed a higher-thanaverage classification accuracy as compared to training only the target subject's MI data without fine-tuning (self-training). The average classification accuracy was improved by 5.12% compared to the case where the target subject's MI was used for training without fine-tuning, and the overall average accuracy was about 79.9%. It was further shown that the amount of training data on which the increase in classification accuracy saturates could be reduced by 47.92% on average. Next, the MIs of three healthy male subjects aged 22-23 years (subjects A, B, and C) were measured and fine-tuning was performed on the MI of each of these three subjects to verify the quantity of training data required to improve the classification accuracy. However, for fine-tuning, the weight coefficients of the model obtained because of prior training with MI from nine subjects included in BCI Competition IV-2a were used. Therefore, the classification accuracy was improved by 9.85% to 66.58% on average. In contrast, fine-tuning had little effect on reducing the amount of training data on which the classification accuracy converged. In conclusion, fine-tuning is effective and improves classification accuracy even when the MI is measured under different conditions.","1849-2266","979-8-3503-1536-3","10.1109/ISPA58351.2023.10279756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10279756","brain-computer interface (BCl);EEG;EEGNet;fine-tuning;motor imagery","Training;Deep learning;Wheelchairs;Training data;Signal processing;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","","","13","IEEE","19 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) might be utilized for communication as well as for controlling wheelchairs, robotic arms, and other medical equipment as well as orthoses & prostheses. Some other strategy is to employ a BCI for rehabilitation in which the user can recover more normal or normal function in the motor rather than replacing the motor function directly through control of a BCI. One popular method for helping stroke victims regain their motor function is motor imagery (MI). Therefore, this article aims to describe a new channel selection-based MI BCIs strategy. In this work, the Gauss Mutated Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (GMBWOA) selects the suited channel in this case. For the congruent selection of optimal channels and solution samples, an objective model is created. Bayesian Linear Discriminate Analysis (BLDA) is used to classify the selected channels and features that were recovered from the original signal using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP).

CSSDM, a novel approach proposed to address the limitation of processing nonhomogeneous signals, such as EEG, extends the capabilities of existing swarm decomposition. In CSSDM, first, the nonhomogeneous EEG signal is analyzed by a density-based spatial clustering algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis-mutual information measure into homogeneous EEG clusters. The CSSDM adopts modified swarm filtering and sparse spectrum to automatically deliver into optimal band-limited modes, which shows the mutual characteristics across channels. Further, the time–frequency graph spectral features are extracted from CSSDM modes.

Many existing methods estimate the uncorrelated instantaneous demixing of EEG signals to classify multiclass motor imagery (MI). However, the condition of uncorrelation does not hold true in practice, because the brain regions work with partial or complete collaboration. This work proposes a novel method, termed as a common Bayesian network (CBN), to discriminate multiclass MI EEG signals. First, with the constraints of a Gaussian mixture model on every channel, only related channels are selected to construct a normal Bayesian network. Second, the nodes that have both common and varying edges are selected to construct a CBN. Third, the probabilities on common edges are used to learn about the support vector machine for classification. To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two well-known BCI datasets and perform a numerical analysis of the propose algorithm for EEG classification in a multiclass MI BCI. Experimental results show that the proposed CBN method not only has excellent classification performance, but also is highly efficient. Hence, it is suitable for the cases where a system is required to respond within a second.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2450680","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272267,61170220,51075306,61273261); International S&T Cooperation Program of China(grant numbers:2013DFM10100); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-11-0381); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167726","Bayesian network (BN);brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);learning algorithm;support vector machine (SVM);Bayesian network (BN);brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);learning algorithm;support vector machine (SVM)","Electroencephalography;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Cognition;Signal to noise ratio","","132","","49","IEEE","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In some recent studies about MI based BCI systems, low accuracy rate and time consuming are common problems. In this thesis, a novel motor imagery algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy rate and computational efficiency at the same time. The architecture of many BCI system is quite complex and they involve time consuming processing. The electroencephalography (EEG) signal is the most commonly used inputs for BCI applications but EEG is often contaminated with noise. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper we use the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction from EEG and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for motor imagery classification. In this study, CSP and LDA have been used to reduce the artifact and classify Mi-based EEG signal. We have used two-level cross validation scheme to determine the subject specific best time window and number of CSP features.

Achieving precise and robust lower limb movement prediction for each patient is crucial. However, the variability in MI response frequencies and brain activation patterns among subjects presents a great challenge to the generalizability of MI-BCIs. This paper proposes a Tuned Heuristic Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (THFGCN) for limb movement prediction in rehabilitation scenarios. THFGCN innovatively designs a learnable EEG frequency band tuned module and a heuristic space topology module. These two modules allow for the intricate extraction of both frequency and spatial topological features, utilizing graph adjacency matrices that encapsulate channel correlations and spatial relationships, hence fostering individualized analysis and enhanced generalizability across subjects. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal convolution module paired with a feature map attention mechanism is proposed to extract the critical spatio-temporal features of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Validation experiments on the PhysioNet and LLM-BCImotion datasets against six mainstream methods demonstrate that THFGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 88.41% and 82.82% accuracy in the within-subject case, and 65.93% and 60.56% accuracy in the cross-subject case, respectively. Detailed frequency band weight and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding visualization validate the effectiveness of proposed modules. Furthermore, feature interpretability analysis proves the extracted features’ profound MI task relevance, underlining THFGCN’s exceptional interpretability. Note to Practitioners—Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) have shown great potential in rehabilitation training for patients with neurological disorders such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI), due to their capacity to promote neural plasticity and functional recovery. An accurate and generalized MI-BCI can accelerate the neural remodeling process in patients and promote the clinical application of BCI technology. In this paper, we propose a new graph convolutional network (GCN)-based MI classification framework to predict limb movements during rehabilitation training. This framework incorporates a frequency tuned topology module and a heuristic space topology module to extract private frequency-domain topological features and shared spatial topological features during MI across subjects. Our method improves the generalization ability to new subjects while ensuring accurate limb movement prediction for single subjects. We show the superiority of our method on two MI datasets, showing that the extracted features have effective physiological interpretability. These findings suggest that the proposed method is not only effective but also transparent, and may support future research in understanding neural mechanisms and optimizing rehabilitation strategies for motor-impaired populations.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3564162","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1964203,62203089,62303092,62103084); German Science Foundation (DFG) in the Project Crossmodal Learning(grant numbers:TRR-169); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M700695); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0890,2022NSFSC0865,2021YFS0383,2023YFG0024,2022YFS0570,2023YFS0213); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2022YGRH003,ZYGX2021YGLH003,ZYGX2024J016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10975806","Motor imagery;brain computer interface;tuned heuristic fusion graph convolutional network;feature visualization;feature interpretability","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Accuracy;Data mining;Motors;Limbs;Training;Topology;Correlation;Graph convolutional networks","","","","48","IEEE","24 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motor Imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) refers to the EEG signals that people imagine their body moving without real action. People who have motor disorders can control the external devices through electroencephalogram (EEG)-decoding. However, there are still a variety of challenges in decoding due to the complexity and non-stationarity of EEG. How to improve the accuracy and robustness of EEG-decoding remains a key question to be studied. In this work, a self-attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with Frequency-Time Band Common Spatial Pattern (FTBCSP) is first introduced for the four-class MI-EEG classification. Self-attention-based CNN is employed on raw data to obtain the channel weights and intensify the spatial information. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), an algorithm that is widely used in MI-EEG decoding, can extract discriminative features between two classes. Features after processing by the CSP algorithm are combined with the above spatial information to accomplish classifying. We validate this method on the publicly available multiclass MI datasets and yield a mean accuracy of 78.12% which performs better than other traditional methods. It proves that the proposed approach makes full use of the temporal and spatial information of EEG and acquires outstanding classification performance on public datasets.","2189-8723","978-1-6654-8229-5","10.1109/ICIIBMS55689.2022.9971698","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Research and Development; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971698","Motor Imagery;Brain-Computer Interface;Electroencephalgram (EEG);attention;Frequency-Time Band Common Spatial Pattern (FTBCSP )","Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Robustness;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Classification algorithms","","","","12","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a spatial graph convolutional neural network based on a self-attentive mechanism. For the spatial characteristics of signals with different channels, we extract spatial features by constructing a graph structure and then by information aggregation; for its temporal characteristics, we use time slicing to calculate the importance weights of different time periods in the input signal by using the self-attentive mechanism, and then update the time segments by weighting and summing, so as to minimize the influence of other interfering signals, complete feature extraction and improve the The classification recognition rate is improved.

Traditional CSP depends only on spatial filtering, that aims to maximize or minimize the ratio of variances of filtered EEG signals in different classes. Recent advances of CSP approaches show that temporal filtering is also preferable to extract discriminative features. In view of this perspective, a novel spatio-temporal filtering strategy is proposed in this paper. To improve computational efficiency and alleviate the overfitting issue frequently encountered in the case of small sample size, the same temporal filter is designed by EEG signals of the same class and shared by all the spatial channels. Spatial and temporal filters can be updated alternatively in practice. Furthermore, each of the resulting designs can still be cast as a CSP problem and tackled efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition. To alleviate the adverse effects of outliers or noisy EEG channels, sparse spatial or temporal filters can also be achieved by incorporating an l1-norm-based regularization term in our CSP problem. The regularized spatial or temporal filter design is iteratively reformulated as a CSP problem via the reweighting technique. Two sets of motor imagery EEG data of BCI competitions are used in our experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2979464","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471157,61772090,61701471,61801055); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2018B23014,2018B47114); Key Development Program of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BE2017071,BE2017647,BE2018004-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028130","Alternative optimization scheme;brain–computer interface (BCI);common spatial pattern (CSP);electroencephalograph (EEG);generalized eigenvalue decomposition;ℓ₁ norm;motor imagery;reweighting technique;spatio-temporal filters;sparsity","Electroencephalography;Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Classification algorithms;Optimization;Brain-computer interfaces","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Sample Size;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","46","","35","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Decoding motor imagery (MI) from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a commonly used approach for this purpose. To reliably identify MI from EEG signals, a sufficient number of sensors is usually required. However, a large number of sensors increases the computational cost of discriminating MI classes. Furthermore, consumer-grade devices that measure EEG signals often employ a reduced number of sensors compared to medical- or research-grade devices. In this experimental study, we investigate the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity when decoding MI from a restricted number of EEG sensors. For this purpose, several decoding pipelines were trained on EEG data using different subsets of electrode locations employing well-established decoding methods. We found that there is no significant difference $\boldsymbol{(\mathrm{p}=[0.18-0.91])}$ in average decoding accuracy when using fewer sensors. The largest loss in performance for a single individual was a reduction in mean decoding accuracy of 0.1 when using 8 out of 64 available sensors.

However, these protocols do not address movements involved in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), which represent an open challenge for the scientific community. Action Observation (AO) has been proposed as a way to improve the recognition of complex tasks. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology to analyze Electroencephalography (EEG) during MI based on manipulation of a cup in different positions, through a first-person representation of a 2D virtual reality. The Power Spectral Density (PSD), Event Related Desynchronization/Synchronization (ERD/ERS), and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) were used to determine differences between MI of Rest and the movements. The results showed significant differences among MI tasks in the mu and beta frequency bands, as well as ERD/ERS mainly marked in the cortico-motor and parieto-central regions of the brain. These findings are important for the implementation of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on MI and complex movements, which could improve usability and controllability in motor rehabilitation. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using AO-based MI protocols for analyzing brain activity during complex movements, which can enhance our understanding of motor imagery and inform the development of new rehabilitation strategies.","","979-8-3503-0613-2","10.1109/ColBioCAS59270.2023.10280841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10280841","2D Virtual Reality;First-Person;Kinesthetic Motor Imagery;Action Observation;Cup Manipulation","Somatosensory;Visualization;Protocols;Sociology;Virtual reality;Electroencephalography;Task analysis","","3","","20","IEEE","17 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though the accuracy of Motor Imagery (MI) BCI systems based on the deep learning have been greatly improved compared with some traditional algorithms, it is still a big problem to clearly interpret the deep learning models. To address the issues, this work first introduces a popular deep learning model EEGNet and compares it with the traditional algorithm Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). After that, this work considers that the 1-D convolution of EEGNet can be explained by a special Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and the depthwise convolution of EEGNet is similar to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. Therefore, this work improves the EEGNet by using the algorithm Temporary Constrained Sparse Group Lasso (TCSGL) to enhance its performance. The proposed model TSGL-EEGNet is tested on the BCI Competition IV 2a and BCI Competition III IIIa datasets that both are 4-classes classification MI tasks. The testing results show that the proposed model has achieved 78.96% (0.7194) average classification accuracy (kappa) on the dataset BCI Competition IV 2a, which are greater than EEGNet, C2CM, MB3DCNN, SS-MEMDBF and FBCSP, especially on insensitive subjects. The proposed model has also achieved 85.30% (0.8040) average classification accuracy (kappa) on the dataset BCI Competition III IIIa, which are greater than the EEGNet, MFTFS et al. At last, this work uses average-validation and stacking to further enhance the effect of the model. The 4-classes classification average accuracy rates reach 81.34% and 88.89%, and the kappas reach 0.7511 and 0.8519 on dataset BCI Competition IV 2a and BCI Competition III IIIa, respectively.

In particular, optimal spatial filters have been designed to classify EEG signals based on band power features. Unfortunately, there are other relevant EEG features for which no optimal spatial filter exists. This is the case for Phase Locking Value (PLV) features, which measure the synchronization between 2 EEG channels. Therefore, this paper proposes to create such a pair of optimal spatial filters for PLV-features. To do so, we optimized a functional measuring the discriminability of PLV-features based on a genetic algorithm. An evaluation of our algorithm on a motor imagery EEG data set showed that using optimized spatial filters led to higher classification performances, and that combining the resulting PLV features with traditional methods boosts the overall BCI performances.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-2893-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853959","Brain-Computer Interfaces;EEG signal processing;Phase Locking Value;Spatial Filter;Genetic Algorithm","Spatial filters;Electroencephalography;Genetic algorithms;Feature extraction;Band-pass filters;Accuracy;Synchronization","","18","","15","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite strides in EEG-based BCIs, challenges like artefacts and low signal-to-noise ratio emphasise the ongoing importance of model transparency. This work proposes using post-hoc explanations to interpret model outcomes and validate them against domain knowledge. Leveraging the GradCAM post-hoc explanation technique on the EEG motor movement/imagery dataset, this work demonstrates that relying solely on accuracy metrics may be inadequate to ensure BCI performance and acceptability. A model trained using all EEG channels of the dataset achieves 72.60% accuracy, while a model trained with motor-imagery/movement-relevant channel data has a statistically insignificant decrease of 1.75%. However, the relevant features for both are very different based on neurophysiological facts. This work demonstrates that integrating domain-specific knowledge with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques emerges as a promising paradigm for validating the neurophysiological basis of model outcomes in BCIs. Our results reveal the significance of neurophysiological validation in evaluating BCI performance, highlighting the potential risks of exclusively relying on performance metrics when selecting models for dependable and transparent BCIs.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781846","Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781846","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Explainable AI;Motor Imagery;EEG","Measurement;Learning systems;Accuracy;Brain modeling;Motors;Electroencephalography;Data models;Brain-computer interfaces;Decoding;Signal to noise ratio","Electroencephalography;Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","25","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, Transformer-based approaches have not been widely explored in motor-imagery EEG classification and visualization, especially lacking general models based on cross-individual validation. Taking advantage of the Transformer model and the spatial-temporal characteristics of the EEG signals, we designed Transformer-based models for classifications of motor imagery EEG based on the PhysioNet dataset. With 3s EEG data, our models obtained the best classification accuracy of 83.31%, 74.44%, and 64.22% on two-, three-, and four-class motor-imagery tasks in cross-individual validation, which outperformed other state-of-the-art models by 0.88%, 2.11%, and 1.06%. The inclusion of the positional embedding modules in the Transformer could improve the EEG classification performance. Furthermore, the visualization results of attention weights provided insights into the working mechanism of the Transformer-based networks during motor imagery tasks. The topography of the attention weights revealed a pattern of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which was consistent with the results from the spectral analysis of Mu and beta rhythm over the sensorimotor areas.

Of primary importance is to use less data and computationally efficient algorithms to support real-time BCI. To this end, an algorithm that exploits the sparse characteristics of EEGs is proposed to classify these signals. Different feature vectors are extracted based on the energies in different frequency sub-bands of the Wavelet Packet decomposition of EEG trials recorded only by five electrodes near the sensorimotor cortex. Features from a small spatial region are approximated by a sparse linear combination of few atoms from a multi-class dictionary constructed from the wavelet features of the projected EEG training signals for each class. This is used to classify the signals based on the pattern of their sparse representation using a minimum-residual decision rule. The results obtained from real data demonstrate that the combination of energy and entropy features enables efficient classification of motor imagery EEG trials related to hand and foot movements. Also, the decomposition used is shown to provide a frequency resolution consistent with the existence of different levels within the alpha band.","","978-1-4799-7591-4","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2015.7418310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7418310","","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Entropy;Rhythm;Electrodes;Training","","4","","18","IEEE","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have facilitated the detection of MI from electroencephalogram (EEG). Previous studies have proposed various EEG-based classification algorithms to identify the MI, however, the performance of prior models was limited due to the cross-subject heterogeneity in EEG data and the shortage of EEG data for training. Therefore, inspired by generative adversarial network (GAN), this study aims to propose an improved domain adaption network based on Wasserstein distance, which utilizes existing labeled data from multiple subjects (source domain) to improve the performance of MI classification on a single subject (target domain). Specifically, our proposed framework consists of three components, including a feature extractor, a domain discriminator, and a classifier. The feature extractor employs an attention mechanism and a variance layer to improve the discrimination of features extracted from different MI classes. Next, the domain discriminator adopts the Wasserstein matrix to measure the distance between source domain and target domain, and aligns the data distributions of source and target domain via adversarial learning strategy. Finally, the classifier uses the knowledge acquired from the source domain to predict the labels in the target domain. The proposed EEG-based MI classification framework was evaluated by two open-source datasets, the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b. Our results demonstrated that the proposed framework could enhance the performance of EEG-based MI detection, achieving better classification results compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.

In this study, the relationship between the EEG recorded during, and the changes in the recovery patterns before and after MI-BCI rehabilitation is investigated. Nine stroke patients underwent 10 sessions of 1 hour MI-BCI rehabilitation with robotic feedback for 2 weeks, 5 times a week. The coherence index (0 ≤ CI ≤ 1), which is an EEG metric comparing the coherences of the EEG in the ipsilesioned hemisphere with that in the contralesioned hemisphere, was computed for each session for the first week. Pre- and post-rehabilitation motor functions were measured with the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA). The number of sessions with CI greater than a unique subject-dependent baseline value ζ correlated with the change in the FMA scores (R = 0.712, p = 0.031). Subsequently, a leave-one-out approach resulted in a prediction mean squared error (MSE) of 15.1 using the established relationship. This result is better compared to using the initial FMA score as a predictor, which gave a MSE value of 18.6.

Several IMFs are suppressed to improve the intelligibility of the EEG for better classification. The features from pre-filtered EEG are extracted by using common spatial pattern (CSP) which is a spatial filtering approach. The two class MI classification is performed by support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method is evaluated by BCI competition III of dataset IVa.

In some studies, minimizing the number of electrodes can be a solution to reduce computational time, cost, and the shape of the EEG device, without compromising the level of accuracy. By choosing particular electrodes which are highly related to the activity, the electrode usage can be reduced.

However, due to the large dimensionality of the multiclass statistical features commonly used in fNIRS signals, it is easy to cause overfitting of the EEG-fNIRS hybrid BCI classifier. Therefore, a low-dimensional feature extraction method for fNIRS based on the EEG-informed fNIRS general linear model (GLM) analysis is proposed in this article. First, a regression coefficient matrix is obtained by using the EEG-informed fNIRS GLM with a time window added, and the common spatial pattern (CSP) features of this regression coefficient matrix are extracted as the fNIRS features. Finally, the fNIRS features were combined with the CSP features extracted from the optimal narrowband of EEG as hybrid features, and the support vector machine (SVM) method is used to classify the samples with hybrid features. The proposed method was tested on a publicly available motor imagery dataset. The classification accuracy using fNIRS signals alone reached 68.79% [oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO)] and 68.62% [deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR)], and the classification accuracy of combining EEG-fNIRS features reached 79.48%, which was higher than other existing methods using the same dataset. By using this fNIRS feature extraction method, the problem of poor performance of CSP on fNIRS signals is solved, which not only enriches the processing methods of fNIRS signals but also improves the classification accuracy of hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI in motor imagery tasks.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3276509","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971168,62071161,62271181); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LZ22F010003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128878","Common space pattern (CSP);electroencephalography (EEG);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);general linear model (GLM);hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI)","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Spatial resolution;Band-pass filters;Brain modeling","","9","","54","IEEE","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: Inspired by the concept of cross-frequency coupling and its correlation with different behavioral tasks, this paper proposes a lightweight Interactive Frequency Convolutional Neural Network (IFNet) to explore cross-frequency interactions for enhancing representation of MI characteristics. IFNet first extracts spectro-spatial features in low and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then the interplay between the two bands is learned using an element-wise addition operation followed by temporal average pooling. Combined with repeated trial augmentation as a regularizer, IFNet yields spectro-spatio-temporally robust features for the final MI classification. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: the BCI competition IV 2a (BCIC-IV-2a) dataset and the OpenBMI dataset. Results: Compared with state-of-the-art MI decoding algorithms, IFNet achieves significantly superior classification performance on both datasets while improving the winner’s result in BCIC-IV-2a by 11%. Moreover, by conducting sensitivity analysis on decision windows, we show IFNet attains the best trade-off between decoding speed and accuracy. Detailed analysis and visualization verify IFNet can capture the coupling across frequency bands along with the known MI signatures. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IFNet for MI decoding. Significance: This study suggests IFNet holds promise for rapid response and accurate control in MI-BCI applications.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3257319","STI 2030—Major Projects(grant numbers:2021ZD0200400); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2023C03003,2022C03011,2021C03001); Chuanqi Research and Development Center of Zhejiang University; Starry Night Science Fund of Zhejiang University Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study(grant numbers:SN-ZJU-SIAS-002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Project for Hangzhou Medical Disciplines of Excellence; Key Project for Hangzhou Medical Disciplines; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070810","Brain–computer interface;motor imagery;cross-frequency interactions;convolutional neural networks;data augmentation","Decoding;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks","Humans;Imagination;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Neural Networks, Computer;Algorithms;Electroencephalography","29","","48","CCBY","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors.

However, existing methods still neglect two key defects in clinical applications: (1) offline processing may not fit inreal-time BCI application scenarios; and (2) direct and arbitrary usage of conventional neural network structures lacks physiological interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid method for EEG artifact elimination, combining a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) module–a blind source separation method with a multi-scaled convolutional neural network (CNN) module. Specifically, the CCA module transfers the recorded EEG signals simultaneously from the channel space to the source space and the CNN module detects and eliminates artifacts with explainable processing. Extensive experiments on semi-simulation, resting-state, and motor imagery EEG datasets were conducted and the results showed competitive performance and strong adaptability of the proposed method.","","978-1-6654-6819-0","10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995132","National Key Research and Development Program of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995132","EEG;artifact elimination;canonical correlation analysis;convolutional neural network;brain-computer interface","Deep learning;Correlation;Scalp;Electroencephalography;Physiology;Brain-computer interfaces;Convolutional neural networks","","1","","37","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining the group sparsity and spatial smoothness of EEG signals, a new EEG classification model is proposed, which is an improvement of group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We call it fused group LASSO. First, group LASSO is used to model the group sparsity of EEG signals, the features of the same channel are assigned the same weights. Then, based on group LASSO, channel weights are regularized by total variation norm (TV-norm), which constrains the weights of adjacent channels to the same or similar, thereby the spatial smoothness modeling of EEG signals can be achieved. Using the primal-dual theory, an optimization algorithm for the new model is given. In order to verify the effectiveness of the new model, experiments were performed on two public brain-computer interface (BCI) competition data sets and one self-collected data set. Compared with the existing sparse optimization methods, the proposed method has achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 79.24%, 86.64% and 81.09%, respectively, and with better physiological interpretability. Compared with spatial filtering methods with smooth constraints, the proposed method realized global spatial smooth in a data-driver manner, and achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 84.96% in two competition data sets.

Because of the discrepancy, the recorded EEG data with different sessions cannot be treated as the same. In this study, we recorded a large intuitive EEG dataset that contained nine types of movements of a single-arm across 12 subjects.

This article investigates the brain activation modulations elicited by imagined movement directions and the EEG features that characterize them. An experiment was conducted in which ten subjects imagined two-dimensional right-hand movement in the left, right, up, and down directions in the vertical plane. The frequency and phase characteristics of EEG rhythms are explored to identify the features that discriminate movement imagination toward multiple directions. The proposed decoding step consists of Fisher's analysis of instantaneous phase values to identify EEG channels with optimal discriminative information followed by extraction of phase-locking values and temporal-spatial features, which are then used for classification. The proposed approach offers significantly higher (p < 0.05) performance than the state-of-the-art method while employing subject-specific time segments and channels. Hence, an average accuracy of 69.25% is obtained for binary classification of all pairs of movement directions with a performance increment of 8.33% compared to the conventional approaches using fixed channel-time paradigm.

Multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) channels could have high accuracy but are not practical for daily life usage compared to a single-channel EEG. However, the single-channel EEG signal has limited sources to extract informative features. Therefore, the aim of the study is to analyze the significant impact of different feature extraction techniques on single EEG channel classification performance. The BCI competition III (IVa) dataset is used for this purpose. Time-frequency domain (E1), and time-domain feature extraction techniques (E2) as well as the combination of both techniques (E3) have been considered to extract the relevant features set from the EEG signals for MI tasks classification. The classification accuracy is obtained with two classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR). The result shows that there is an enhancement in classification accuracy on certain channels and participants, with E3 being higher than E1 and E2. The C3 channel in E3 has the highest accuracy (87.1 %) when SVM is the classifier. The proposed approach improves the classification accuracy of AF4 by up to 70% and 70.4% by using SVM and LR, respectively, which is considered acceptable for usage in a BCI system. This implies that MI tasks can be detected with a single-channel EEG by using the proposed method even if the channel is located on the forehead.","","979-8-3503-0415-2","10.1109/IICAIET59451.2023.10291499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10291499","Motor Imagery;Single-Channel EEG;time-domain features;time-frequency features;BCI","Support vector machines;Time-frequency analysis;Logistic regression;Forehead;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Task analysis","","","","35","IEEE","27 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional works classify EEG signals without considering the topological relationship among electrodes. However, neuroscience research has increasingly emphasized network patterns of brain dynamics. Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately reflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) is presented to enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types of motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological relationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson’s matrix of overall signals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes is built up. The GCNs-Net constructed by graph convolutional layers learns the generalized features. The followed pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and the fully-connected (FC) softmax layer derives the final prediction. The introduced approach has been shown to converge for both personalized and groupwise predictions. It has achieved the highest averaged accuracy, 93.06% and 88.57% (PhysioNet dataset), 96.24% and 80.89% (high gamma dataset), at the subject and group level, respectively, compared with existing studies, which suggests adaptability and robustness to individual variability. Moreover, the performance is stably reproducible among repetitive experiments for cross-validation. The excellent performance of our method has shown that it is an important step toward better BCI approaches. To conclude, the GCNs-Net filters EEG signals based on the functional topological relationship, which manages to decode relevant features for brain MI.

The problem becomes more challenging while decoding the brain signals of stroke patients due to altered neurodynamics caused by lesions. Recently, several deep learning architectures came into the picture although they often failed to produce superior accuracy compared to the traditional approaches and mostly do not follow an end-to-end architecture as they depend on custom features. However, a few of them have the promising ability to create more generalizable features in an end-to-end fashion such as the popular EEGNet architecture. Although EEGNet was applied for decoding stroke patients’ motor imagery (MI) data, its performance was as good as the traditional methods. In this study, we have augmented the EEGNet-based decoding by introducing a postprocessing step called the longest consecutive repetition (LCR) in a sliding window-based approach and named it EEGNet + LCR. The proposed approach was tested on a dataset of ten hemiparetic stroke patients’ MI dataset yielding superior performance against the only EEGNet and a more traditional approach such as common spatial pattern (CSP) + support vector machine (SVM) for both within- and cross-subject decoding of MI signals.

Specifically, a characteristic low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to artifacts, non-stationary effects, and inter-subject (user) variability, are problematic. Consequently, there is a need to maximise signal quality and robustness. These criteria were at the fore during the development of the FlexEEG system, which is a lowcost, unobtrusive, wearable neurotechnology built on a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) substrate that folds around the head and is concealable in standard headwear. The aim of this paper is to compare the flexEEG system and a medical grade EEG system, through empirically testing the respective performances of each on a simulated dataset, as well as within the framework of a motor-imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, and a motion onset visual evoked potentials (mVEP) BCI paradigm. Three healthy participants completed two training sessions on separate days, using both the FlexEEG (NeuroCONCISE) and the medical grade EEG headset, to evaluate performance on a 2-class motor-imagery task and 5 class mVEP task. Decoding accuracies are compared across training sessions for each headset. The EEG system for the comparison is a high-performance non-invasive medical product for use within research and clinical environments. The signal quality of EEG produced by each headset is also compared by assessing in terms of power spectral density of simulated sinusoidal data at 2 Hz, 8 Hz, 16 Hz and 25 Hz. Decoding accuracies are compared across training sessions for each headset. Insignificant differences were observed between performances of both headsets regarding signal quality and functional capability, suggesting the flexEEG offers potential as a reliable, low-cost wearable neurotechnology for EEG research and end-use applications.","","978-1-6654-8574-6","10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967511","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Department for the Economy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967511","Wearable;EEG;Motor-imagery;BCI;mVEP","Headphones;Training;Electric potential;Visualization;Flexible printed circuits;Electroencephalography;Decoding","","1","","17","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, this paper proposes an attention-based multiscale spatial-temporal convolutional network (AMSTCNet). First, a multi-branch structure is designed to extract high-dimensional spatial-temporal representations at different scales. Second, Squeeze-Excite-Compress (SEC) blocks are proposed to highlight feature responses within a single scale and weighted to fuse these features to reduce information redundancy. Finally, the attention-based temporal convolutional network is used to obtain deep temporal information of the signal to dynamically fuse features at different scales.

However, the inherent complex properties of EEG signals pose a challenge in their analysis and modeling. This letter proposes a novel approach of integrating wavelet scattering transform (WST) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying motor imagery (MI) via EEG signals (referred as WST-CNN), capable of extracting distinctive characteristics in signals even when the data is limited. In this architecture, the first layer is nontrainable WST features with fixed initializations in WST-CNN. Furthermore, WSTs are robust to local perturbations in data, especially in the form of translation invariance, and resilient to deformations, thereby enhancing the network's reliability. The performance of the proposed idea is evaluated on the DBCIE dataset for three different scenarios: left-arm (LA) movement, right-arm (RA) movement, and simultaneous movement of both arms (BA). The BCI Competition IV-2a dataset was also employed to validate the proposed concept across four distinct MI tasks, such as movements in: left-hand (LH), right-hand (RH), feet (FT), and tongue (T). The classifications' performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy ($\eta$), sensitivity ($S_{e}$), specificity ($S_{p}$), and weighted F1-score, which reached up to 92.72%, 92.72%, 97.57%, and 92.75% for classifying LH, RH, FT, and T on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset and 89.19%, 89.19%, 94.60%, and 89.33% for classifying LA, RA, and BA, on the DBCIE dataset, respectively.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3488356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10748355","Sensor signal processing;brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);DBCIE;electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);wavelet scattering transform (WST)","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Wavelet transforms;Scattering;Transforms;Deformation;Sensor systems and applications;Image processing","","1","","22","IEEE","8 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since distribution shifts across subjects, the performance of most current deep neural networks for decoding EEG signals degrades when dealing with unseen subjects. Domain generalization (DG) aims to tackle this issue by learning invariant representations across subjects. To this end, we propose a novel domain-generalized EEG classification framework, named FDCL, to generalize EEG decoding through category-relevant and -irrelevant Feature Decorrelation and Cross-view invariant feature Learning. Specifically, we first devise data augmented regularization through mixing the segments of same-category features from multiple subjects, which increases the diversity of EEG data by spanning the space of subjects. Furthermore, we introduce feature decorrelation regularization to learn the weights of the augmented EEG trials to remove the dependencies between their features, so that the true mapping relationship between relevant features and corresponding labels can be better established. To further distill subject-invariant EEG feature representations, cross-view consistency learning regularization is introduced to encourage consistent predictions of category-relevant features induced from different augmented EEG views. We seamlessly integrate three complementary regularizations into a unified DG framework to jointly improve the generalizability and robustness of the model on unseen subjects. Experimental results on motor imagery (MI) based EEG datasets validate that the proposed FDCL outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3300961","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902197,61802177); Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:23KJB520012); Project of Photonics Research Institute (PRI) in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:P0046003); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:PolyU 152006/19E); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198467","Electroencephalograph;domain generalization;data augmentation;motor imagery","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Decoding;Data augmentation;Decorrelation;Data models;Robustness","Humans;Algorithms;Neural Networks, Computer;Learning;Electroencephalography;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Imagination","4","","43","CCBY","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity of the brain from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp. Recent years have seen a surge of research in the use of EEG for control of an output device such as a computer application or a neuro-prosthesis. Motor imagery (MI), the mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates an action induces changes in EEG signals. EEG based classification of MI holds promise for development of pervasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This paper discusses work undertaken at Tezpur University in pursuit of this goal.Most of the current BCI systems are developed based on traditional signal processing techniques under the assumption that the signal is Gaussian and has linear characteristics. However, MI related EEG is highly non-Gaussian, non-stationary and non-linear. We have undertaken experiments to explore the use of bispectrum of EEG in estimation of MI. Bispectrum analysis is presented to analyze EEG signals recorded during imagination and observation of hand movements. EEG signals are recorded from primary hand areas i.e. from electrode position C3 and C4. Our preliminary investigation, have shown the ability of bispectrum in detecting non-linear phase coupling between alpha and beta rhythms during observation and imagination of hand movement. Bispectrum analysis of EEG provides a way to efficiently discriminate MI.","","978-1-4577-0720-9","10.1109/NCCISP.2012.6189675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189675","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroencephalogram (EEG) motor imagery (MI) signal is a common method used to communicate between the human brain and the computer interface. However, differentiating between multiple motor imagery signals may be challenging due to the presence of high noise-to-signal ratio and small dataset sizes. In this study, we propose a variational autoencoder and transformer-attention based convolutional neural network (SSTACNet) for multi-class EEG-based motor imagery classification. The SSTACNet model leverages upon variational autoencoders’ ability to measure the contrastive distance between two sets of inputs to perform data self-selection.

In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, features that characterize ERS/ERD phenomenon could favor the discriminant of different kinds of MI tasks. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), a spatial filtering method which is often used in MI-EEG feature extraction, shows outstanding performance due to its effectiveness in maximizing the difference of variance between each class. But one of the shortcomings of CSP is that performance is greatly affected by the frequency of the signal, because the variances can be used to discriminate each class only by processing those task related frequency bands. However, individual differences existed in EEG is an obstacle for CSP. Although MI related frequency bands focus on mu and beta rhythms, for every subject, the distinguishing bands could be different. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method (Subject Dependent Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition, SD-MEMD) for MI based BCI is proposed, it utilizes MEMD algorithm to decompose the multi-channel EEG into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), each IMF represents an inherent oscillation mode of the raw signal.

However, individual anatomical and physiological differences cause subject-specific variability of EEG signals for the same task, and BCI systems thus require a calibration procedure that adjusts system parameters to each subject. To overcome this problem, we propose a subject-invariant deep neural network (DNN) using baseline-EEG signals that can be recorded from subjects resting in comfortable states. We first modeled the deep features of EEG signals as a decomposition of subject-invariant and subject-variant features corrupted by anatomical/physiological characteristics. Subject-variant features were then removed from the deep features by learning the network with a baseline correction module (BCM) using the underlying individual information in baseline-EEG signals. The subject-invariant loss forces the BCM to assemble subject-invariant features that have the same class, irrespective of the subject. Using 1-min baseline-EEG signals of the new subject, our algorithm can eliminate subject-variant components from test data without the calibration process. The experimental results show that our subject-invariant DNN framework significantly increases decoding accuracies of the conventional DNN methods for BCI systems. Furthermore, feature visualizations illustrate that the proposed BCM extracts subject-invariant features that are close to each other in the same class.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3238421","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:RS-2023-00208492,2020M3C1B8081320,2021R1A4A5033480); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026478","Baseline correction;brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);motor imagery;subject-invariant neural network","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Deep learning;Data mining;Calibration;Brain modeling","","9","","51","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike traditional global channel selection methods that ignore channel location and discard channels completely, the proposed method preserves local information and allows selective inclusion or exclusion of channels in different local regions. Channels are optimized to minimize confusion area score, a criterion that assesses the misclassification risk of a Riemannian feature based on Riemannian distance distributions, using a backward iterative algorithm. The EEG signals from each channel-optimized local region are decomposed using a filter bank, and a local covariance matrix is computed for each subband. Several matrices are selected based on the confusion area score, mapped to the tangent space, and fed to a classifier. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated using the publicly available BCI Competition III dataset IVa, and the results show that the optimization of local region channels improves the performance and achieves higher classification accuracy compared to the related existing methods.","2572-7672","979-8-3503-0943-0","10.1109/BCI60775.2024.10480489","Korea University; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10480489","Brain-Computer Interface (BCI);Electroencephalogram (EEG);Motor Imagery (MI);Local region;Channel selection;Riemannian distance;Filter bank","Support vector machines;Filter banks;Motors;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Matrix decomposition;Iterative methods","","1","","14","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, for classification tasks based on EEG, researchers would extract features from raw signals manually which is often time consuming and requires adequate domain knowledge. Besides that, features manually extracted and selected may not generalize well due to the limitation of human. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) plays an important role in the wave of deep learning and achieve amazing results in many areas. One of the most attractive features of deep learning for EEG-based tasks is the end-to-end learning. Features are learned from raw signals automatically and the feature extractor and classifier are optimized simultaneously. There are some researchers applying deep learning methods to EEG analysis and achieving promising performances. However, supervised deep learning methods often require large-scale annotated dataset, which is almost impossible to acquire in EEG-based tasks. This problem limits the further improvements of deep learning models for classification based on EEG. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method DMTL-BCI based on Multi-Task Learning framework for EEG-based classification tasks.

By combining these two types of signals, the study aimed to understand how feature fusion affected classification accuracy for MI. The EEG signals were filtered into three bands ( $\theta $ : 4–7 Hz,  $\alpha $ : 8–13 Hz,  $\beta $ : 14–30 Hz), while the fNIRS signals were filtered into 0.02-0.08 Hz to improve signal quality for subsequent analysis. The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm was utilized to extract features from both EEG and fNIRS signals. This allowed the researchers to create a fused signal with both EEG and fNIRS features that could then be processed using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the processed data was fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which improved the mean accuracy rate of MI to 92.25%. By comparing the classification accuracies obtained with fused and unfused segments of EEG and fNIRS signals, the study discovered that fusing the signals significantly improved classification accuracy by 5%-10%. Furthermore, analyzing the activated brain regions using fNIRS showed that the auxiliary motor cortex was significantly activated during MI.

If results are confirmed with a larger sample, the montage could be used to optimize feet MI performance and improve the outcome of MI-based brain-computer interfaces, which are used during motor neurorehabilitation.","1945-7901","978-1-5386-2296-4","10.1109/ICORR.2017.8009349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8009349","","Electroencephalography;DC motors;Electrodes;Current density;Foot;Visualization;Analysis of variance","Electroencephalography;Foot;Hand;Humans;Imagination;Motor Cortex;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","1","","14","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By using attentional mechanisms, the network can improve the accuracy of the classification task by focusing on the most important parts of the input signals. Functional connectivity of the human brain is a complex field requiring expert clinical knowledge due to the swift alterations in bodily functions, anomalies, and significant differences between individuals often present in EEG signals. These factors make it challenging to accurately classify EEG signals as normal or abnormal. However, the classification task can be made more manageable by using brain network representation of EEG signals. Brain network representation allows for the creation of a graph-based model of the functional connectivity of the human brain, which can be used to recognize important patterns and features in the EEG signals that are relevant to specific brain activities or conditions. The aim is to assess the efficacy of attentional mechanisms in a crucial scenario by examining the brain network representation of EEG signals recorded during a task that involves distinguishing between normal and abnormal EEG patterns.","","979-8-3503-1590-5","10.1109/ACCAI58221.2023.10199507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10199507","Attentional Mechanisms;EEG Classification;Brain Networkrepresentation;Graph Analysis","Deep learning;Neuroscience;Focusing;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Robustness;Pattern recognition","","","","16","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite recent advancements, Transformer-based decoding methods often neglect the explicit temporal priors inherent in EEG signals, i.e., the dependency between tokens tends to diminish as their relative temporal distance increases, which limits the efficacy of these decoding approaches. Inspired by the recent Retentive Network (RetNet), we develop a novel convolutional retentive network for EEG decoding (RetEEG), which integrates temporal priors into the self-attention mechanism to tackle the above challenge. Specifically, RetEEG incorporates a convolution module to capture local EEG features and cascades multiple bidirectional retention modules to learn global correlations within these local features. The bidirectional retention module introduces a temporal decay matrix, which imparts prior knowledge to the self-attention mechanism by accounting for variations in relative temporal distances. To validate the superiority of RetEEG, we conducted experiments on two publicly available EEG datasets.

Moreover, it has been suggested that motor imagery-specific EEG differences can be enhanced by feedback training. However, the differences observed in the EEGs of naive subjects are typically not sufficient to provide reliable EEG control and thus result in unintended feedback. Such feedback can frustrate subjects and impede training. In this study, a hybrid BCI paradigm combining motor imagery and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been proposed to provide effective continuous feedback for motor imagery training. Methods: During the initial training sessions, subjects must focus on flickering buttons to evoke SSVEPs as they perform motor imagery tasks. The output/feedback of the hybrid BCI is based on hybrid features consisting of motor imagery- and SSVEP-related brain signals. In this context, the SSVEP plays a more important role than motor imagery in generating feedback. As the training progresses, the subjects can gradually decrease their visual attention to the flickering buttons, provided that the feedback is still effective. In this case, the feedback is mainly based on motor imagery. Results: Our experimental results demonstrate that subjects generate distinguishable brain patterns of hand motor imagery after only five training sessions lasting approximately 1.5 h each. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid feedback paradigm can be used to enhance motor imagery training. Significance: This hybrid BCI system with feedback can effectively identify the intentions of the subjects.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2402283","National High-Tech R&D Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2012AA011601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91120305,61401162); Guangdong Province Science Foundation for Research Team Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038194","Brain-computer interface (BCI);motor imagery training;neuro-feedback;Brain–computer interface (BCI);hybrid feature;motor imagery training;neuro-feedback;steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs)","Training;Electroencephalography;Calibration;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Correlation;Brain modeling","Adult;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Feedback;Female;Humans;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Male;Young Adult","96","","35","IEEE","10 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To alleviate these limitations, multi-brain BCI has emerged based on the integration of multiple individuals’ intelligence. Nevertheless, the existing decoding methods mainly use linear averaging or feature integration learning from multi-brain EEG data, and do not effectively utilize coupling relationship features, resulting in undesired decoding accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we proposed an EEG-based multi-brain MI decoding method, which utilizes coupling feature extraction and few-shot learning to capture coupling relationship features among multi-brains with only limited EEG data.

Since brain dynamics oscillate greatly between and across participants, it is difficult to build effective handcrafted features based on existing information. In an effort to fill the before-mentioned limitation, this paper offers a Graph-based Convolutional Neural Network Model (G-CNNM) to investigate EEG features across participants for motor imagery classification. Initially, a structure in the form of a graph is created with the intention of representing the location information of EEG nodes. The next step is for a convolutional neural network model to learn EEG features from both the spatial and temporal dimensions, with an emphasis placed on the temporal periods that are most distinguished. An evaluation of the proposed methodology was performed on a benchmark EEG datasetBCICIV2a- for motor imagery classification. Evidence from this study demonstrates that the G-CNNM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy scoring 72.57%.

In particular, a previous work on the same dataset found a higher cognitive effort for the neurofeedback group than for the control group, which was confirmed by the results of the NASA-TLX questionnaire. EEG signals were acquired with an 8-electrode dry device. The EEG features of the mental effort were identified by using the Sequential Feature Selector (SFS), in combination with different classifiers, on the EEG data of the control group. In order to classify between low and high mental effort (baseline accuracy of 50 %), four EEG features and the Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier resulted in the best combination for the mental effort assessment in the control group, achieving an average accuracy of 82.1 ± 8.7 %.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2018.2841847","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91420302,61573142); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WH1516018,222201717006); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1421948,BCS-1551688); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:14.756.31.0001); Polish National Science Center(grant numbers:2016/20/W/N24/00354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8386437","Brain–computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);sparse group spatial pattern;temporal constraint","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Optimization;Support vector machines;Brain modeling;Cybernetics","Algorithms;Brain;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Task Performance and Analysis","261","","72","IEEE","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The single-trial covariance matrix (CM) features computed from the EEG signals are transformed into a Riemannian geometry frame and tangent space features are computed by considering the lower triangular matrix.

Motor Imagery(MI) Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of brain signals commonly used in the BCI system. Recently, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have received widespread attention and provided better classification performance in MI EEG classification compared to other state of art approaches because they can learn the features that are most relevant to the task at hand. However, the performance of CNN largely depends on its architecture as well as the quality and quantity of training data. Current MI EEG data are scarce because the data collection is relatively expensive and therefore effective data augmentation methods are particularly important to improve the MI classification performance. In this paper, we first propose a shallow CNN architecture as well as a new and effective data augmentation method to compensate the shortcoming of data insufficiency, then we apply the method of superposing and normalizing the signals of the same labels across subjects and time to generate additional EEG data. The proposed superimposed data augmentation method can enable the signals preserve the intrinsic characteristics and reduce the signals drift over time and subjects. We evaluate the proposed architecture and method on the PhysioNet dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture performs better than the previous architectures and can achieve an average accuracy of 91.06% in two-class classification tasks. In addition, the proposed data augmentation method can improve the average accuracy from 73.46% to 76.78% in four-class classification tasks for all 109 subjects, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-1-7281-9594-0","10.1109/ICCICC50026.2020.9450227","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9450227","Brain Computer Interface;Electroencephalogram;Convolutional Neural Network;Data Augmentation","Deep learning;Convolution;Training data;Computer architecture;Muscles;Data collection;Electroencephalography","","1","","32","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The classification results of the combined kernel function are compared with results of the Gaussian kernel function and the Cauchy kernel function. The experimental results show that the highest classification accuracy of the proposed kernel function and the single kernel function in the first data set are 64.40% and 60.60%, respectively, and in the second data sets are 67.58% and 63.33%. The average classification accuracy of the proposed kernel function is 4%-4.19% higher than that of the single kernel function. These results show that the proposed method is advantageous in the classification of four-class motor imagery.","2152-744X","978-1-5090-6759-6","10.1109/ICMA.2017.8015957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015957","RVM;OVO-CSP;Motor imagery;Single kernel function;Combined kernel function","Kernel;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Brain modeling;Classification algorithms","","9","","20","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Estimation of cortical activity was performed on high resolution EEG data related to the imagination of limb movements gathered in five normal healthy subjects by using realistic head models. Cortical activity was estimated in region of interest associated with the subject's Brodmann areas by using depth-weighted minimum norm solutions. Comparisons between surface recorded EEG and the estimated cortical activity were performed. The estimated cortical activity related to the mental imagery of limbs in the five subjects is located mainly over the contralateral primary motor area. The unbalance between brain activity estimated in contralateral and ipsilateral motor cortical areas relative to the finger movement imagination is greater than those obtained in the scalp EEG recordings. Results suggest that the use of the estimated cortical activity for the motor imagery of upper limbs could be potentially superior with respect to the use of surface EEG recordings. This is due to a greater statistically significant unbalance between the activity estimated in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere with respect to those observed with surface EEG. These results are useful in the context of the development of a non invasive brain computer interface.","","0-7803-8439-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1404217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404217","Brain Computer Interface;high resolution EEG;Imagination of movements","Brain computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Image resolution;Fingers;Current density;Image analysis;State estimation;Magnetic heads;Brain modeling;Scalp","","2","","3","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effectiveness of these systems depends significantly on the precise extraction of features from EEG signals, which is essential for translating user intent into commands for external devices. Traditional methods often fail to accommodate individual differences when selecting optimal frequency bands for Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) analysis. To address this limitation, we developed the Harmony Search Common Spatial Pattern (HSCSP) approach, which utilizes the Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm to dynamically refine frequency band selection. This method efficiently identifies optimal bands by systematically evaluating the impact of different selections on classification accuracy. Subsequently, features are extracted using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) from the CSP-processed EEG data, maximizing inter-class distinction and intra-class compactness. Cross-session experiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset validate the efficacy of our approach, achieving an accuracy of 73.9%, significantly outperforming existing benchmark methods.

Existing EEG classification methods either heavily depend on the handcrafted features or require adequate annotated samples at each session for calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic joint domain adaptation network based on adversarial learning strategy to learn domain-invariant feature representation, and thus improve EEG classification performance in the target domain by leveraging useful information from the source session. Specifically, we explore the global discriminator to align the marginal distribution across domains, and the local discriminator to reduce the conditional distribution discrepancy between sub-domains via conditioning on deep representation as well as the predicted labels from the classifier. In addition, we further investigate a dynamic adversarial factor to adaptively estimate the relative importance of alignment between the marginal and conditional distributions.

These conditions may vary with respect to the number of electrodes, the time and effort that can be invested by the user for training/calibrating the system prior to its use, as well as the duration or even the type of the imaginary task that is most convenient for the user. Hence, it is desirable to design classification schemes that are not only accurate in terms of the classification output but also robust to changes in the operational conditions. Towards this goal, we propose a new sparse representation classification scheme that extends current sparse representation schemes by exploiting the group sparsity of relevant features. Based on this scheme each test signal is represented as a linear combination of train trials that are further constrained to belong in the same MI class. Our expectation is that this constrained linear combination exploiting the grouping structure of the training data will lead to representations that are more robust to varying operational conditions. Moreover, in order to avoid overfitting and provide a model with good generalization abilities we adopt the bayesian framework and, in particular, the Variational Bayesian Framework since we use a specific approximate posterior to exploit the grouping structure of the data. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm on two MI datasets using electroencephalograms (EEG) that allowed us to simulate different operational conditions like the number of available channels, the number of training trials, the type of MI tasks, as well as the duration of each trial.

Classification of motor imagery tasks for BMIs is the crucial part. Classification accuracy not only depends on how accurate and robust the classifier is; it is also about data. For well separated data, classifiers such as kernel SVM can handle classification and deliver acceptable results. If a feature provides large interclass difference for different classes, immunity to random noise and chaotic behavior of EEG signal is rationally conformed, which means the applied feature is suitable for classifying EEG signals. In this work, in order to have less computational complexity, time-domain algorithms are employed to motor imagery signals. Extracted features are: Mean Absolute Value, Maximum peak value, Simple Square Integral, Willison Amplitude, and Waveform Length. Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel is applied for classification of four different classes of data. The obtained results show that these features have acceptable, distinct values for different these four motor imagery tasks. Maximum classification accuracy belongs to contribution of Willison amplitude as feature and SVM as classifier, with 95.1 percentages accuracy.

Motor Imagery (MI) basically involves imaginations of any body part that leads to the activation of sensorimotor cortex which modulates the oscillation in EEG. BCI can be done by both Invasive and Non-invasive methods. In invasive, BCI are implanted into the gray matter of individual's brain by neurosurgery. Invasive method produce highest quality signals as they are directly lie in the gray matter. But gradually its signal strength weakens as scare-tissue build ups and as body always react to the foreign object in the brain [1]. Non-invasive BCI is preferred as it is easy to wear and do not require surgery. EEG is most studied non-invasive BCI because of its high temporal resolution and ease to use and low coast set up. Individual difference is the major issue in MI based BCI. Algorithms that can successfully overcome individual differences is to create diverse ensemble classifiers which uses sub-band common spatial pattern method (SBCSP). To aggregate the output of this ensemble, we use fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques.

However, it remains uncertain whether neural patterns different from the traditional inherent limbs motor imagery (MI) can be extracted, which is essential for high-dimensional control of external devices. In this work, we established a MI neo-framework consisting of novel supernumerary robotic sixth-finger MI (SRF-MI) and traditional right-hand MI (RH-MI) paradigms and validated the distinctness of EEG response patterns between two MI tasks for the first time. Twenty-four subjects were recruited for this experiment involving three mental tasks. Event-related spectral perturbation was adopted to supply details about event-related desynchronization (ERD). Activation region, intensity and response time (RT) of ERD were compared between SRF-MI and RH-MI tasks. Three classical classification algorithms were utilized to verify the separability between different mental tasks. And genetic algorithm aims to select optimal combination of channels for neo-framework. A bilateral sensorimotor and prefrontal modulation was found during the SRF-MI task, whereas in RH-MI only contralateral sensorimotor modulation was exhibited. The novel SRF-MI paradigm enhanced ERD intensity by a maximum of 117% in prefrontal area and 188% in the ipsilateral somatosensory-association cortex. And, a global decrease of RT was exhibited during SRF-MI tasks compared to RH-MI. Classification results indicate well separable performance among different mental tasks (88.1% maximum for 2-class and 88.2% maximum for 3-class).

Motor imagery does not require external stimulation and is one of the most widely used BCI paradigms, and is now widely used to address the treatment of neurological impairments such as paralysis, stroke, and acromegaly. Electrophysiological source imaging is a technique based on the observation of electromagnetic signals from the cerebral cortex, reflecting the electrophysiological activity of brain nerve cells on the scalp surface of the brain. The wavelet transform, on the other hand, is commonly used for the processing of non-smooth signals and aims to extract excellent signal features. This paper combines these two algorithms as feature extraction methods. In recent years, deep learning has been increasingly combined with MI-EEG-based BCI. GoogLeNet is one of the most classical convolutional neural networks and has made a splash in ImageNet image recognition.

Rehabilitation is required to restore function and independence. So, monitoring instruments such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) are required. EEG records the electrical brain activity, which needs feature extraction before classification. It is done to obtain variables that distinguish the stroke scale captured through EEG signals. Some of these are the ability to imagine movement or motor imagery and the difference in waves from symmetric channel pairs. This paper proposes a stroke scale classification method based on EEG signals using multi-networks of two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. Wavelet filters separate EEG signals into some frequency bands called waves. The multi-network capability allows CNN to map EEG signal variables into class features simultaneously. The 2D-CNN, with its precision in connecting inter-channel and inter-temporal signals, ensures reliable classification. The frequency bands of EEG signals represent the variables of motor imagery and the asymmetry of channel pairs. The experimental results show that motor imagery and asymmetric channel pairs based on EEG signals are characteristics of stroke levels. The proposed method, a multi-network 2D CNN, achieves an accuracy of 90.19%, 9% higher than that of a single network. In addition, multi-network 2D CNN also speeds up computation, which is very beneficial in EEG signals. The experiment also tested the fact that stroke information is almost identical in all channels. Motor imagery variables are slightly more accurate than the asymmetry of symmetric channel pairs.","","979-8-3503-5531-4","10.1109/EECSI63442.2024.10776276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10776276","Stroke;Rehabilitation;EEG;Wavelet;Motor Imagery;Asymmetric;Channel;2D CNN;Multi 2D CNN","Accuracy;Stroke (medical condition);Motors;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Software;Real-time systems;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability;Biomedical imaging","","","","28","IEEE","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For end-to-end deep learning methods, researchers encode spatial information with convolution neural networks (CNNs) from raw EEG data. Compared with CNNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allow for long-range lateral interactions between features. In this paper, we proposed a pure RNNs-based parallel method for encoding spatial and temporal sequential raw data with bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory (bi-LSTM) and standard LSTM, respectively. Firstly, we rearranged the index of EEG electrodes considering their spatial location relationship. Secondly, we applied sliding window method over raw EEG data to obtain more samples and split them into training and testing sets according to their original trial index. Thirdly, we utilized the samples and their transposed matrix as input to the proposed pure RNNs- based parallel method, which encodes spatial and temporal information simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in the public MI-based eegmmidb dataset and compared with the other three methods (CSP+LDA, FBCSP+LDA, and CNN-RNN method).

The majority of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are time-domain recordings with distinct frequency components linked to particular brain activity. The time-domain data for EEG signals is a depiction of the electrical voltage variations across time. In this work, we looked at how combining classifiers based on wavelet features can help BCI systems classify EEG signals more accurately. Ten healthy individuals were told to see the right hand moving at predetermined intervals and perform “open” and “close” operations during data acquisition. Three electrodes have been placed on the individuals' scalps to collect data. Imbalanced MI-EEG data has proved difficult in recent years. Eliminating imbalanced MI-EEG channel data is the primary way to improve the performance of the classifying algorithms. Using machine learning techniques and MI-BCI-EEG channel imbalanced data processed with SMOTE will make it easier to look through huge amounts of data to find lies. This system used SMOTE to eliminate the unbalanced EEG channel data set. To enhance system performance and facilitate lie detection, these balanced data sets are trained with multiple classifiers, including KNN, DT, LR, RF, and SVM. This algorithm compares performance parameters such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, precision, and sensitivity.

Due to spatial lateralization of different MI tasks, spatial filtering followed by band power extraction is the most commonly used algorithm for classification tasks in MI-based BCIs. Unfortunately, the spatial filtering approach significantly incorporates Amplitude characteristics when compared to Phase characteristics of the EEG signal. Single trial Phase locking value (sPLV) has been a popular statistics to extract phase based information for classification task in MI-based BCI. To utilize the phase characteristics for MI classification, this paper proposes a novel approach based on instantaneous phase difference (IPD) sequence to extract phase features that explicitly use the phase synchronization information between EEG sensors. We maximized the discriminability of IPD sequence using linear transformation calculated from common spatial pattern algorithm (CSP) on the IPD sequence. An evaluation of our method on BCI competition dataset led to around 15% increase in mean classification accuracies compared to sPLV approach and comparable accuracies to power feature based CSP algorithm.

This work provides a natural basis for developing an efficient BCI based on single-source data obtained by independent component analysis of multi-channel EEG. The tasks to be discriminated are the imagination of hand grasping and opening and the resting state. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. Imagery is the essential part of the most EEG-based communication systems.

The motivation of this work comes from the need for a BCI system, intended to operate in real world scenarios, to discriminate multiple tasks and activities simultaneously. In this regard, the paper proposes a novel multi-class EEG-based BCI system via utilization of error correcting output coding (ECOC) classifiers. To best of our knowledge, the ECOC classifiers have not ever been applied to the EEG classification problems. In the ECOC method, the classification problem is modeled as communication over a noisy channel where the miss-classification error is corrected by error correcting techniques borrowed from information theory. In this work, we propose to utilize a modified version of the ECOC classifiers adopted to EEG classification problems which deploys ternary class codewords. Therefore, we analyze more combinations of the classes and greater number of classifiers vote for the final result. The proposed classifier is coupled with a Bayesian framework to compute the optimized spatio-spectral filters to extract the most discriminative feature sets of different classes. The proposed framework is applied to a motor imagery classification problem and evaluated over BCI Competition IV-2a dataset where the results indicate a noticeable enhancement over other methods developed for multi-class EEG classification.","","978-1-5386-1645-1","10.1109/SMC.2017.8122952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8122952","Brain-computer interface (BCI);Common spatial patterns;Electroencephalogram (EEG);Error correction output coding;Motor Imagery","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Encoding;Covariance matrices;Bayes methods;Hamming distance","","9","","21","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We recorded and analyzed EEG data from two patients suffering from phantom limb pain. The recordings were conducted during a pain-relieving stimulation and in its absence. In both patients we observed a decrease in alpha power when the pain was suppressed by stimulation. Individual differences were observed, as well. In one patient the alpha power effects were prominent in the parietal sites whereas in the other in the somatosensory cortex bilaterally. Thus, modulations of alpha power could be used as a biomarker of pain in amputees, and such a biomarker could be useful for pain monitoring, as well as building closed-loop pain-relieving systems that operate automatically.","","978-1-6654-6329-4","10.1109/CNN56452.2022.9912563","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:21-75-30024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912563","EEG;electrical stimulation;pain suppression","Pathology;Pain;Buildings;Phantoms;Electrical stimulation;Electroencephalography;Recording","","1","","5","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FACT-Net incorporates a Frequency Adapter (FA) module designed for processing the frequency features of MI-EEG data, as well as a Temporal-Periodicity Inception (TPI) module specifically for handling global periodic signals in MI. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on the cross-day dataset collected from 67 subjects and the BCIC-IV-2a dataset. The FACT-Net achieved an accuracy of 48.32% and 80.67% higher than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, demonstrating excellent performance in MI decoding. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional memory efficiency and inference time, indicating significant potential for practical applications. We anticipate that FACT-Net will set a new baseline for MI-EEG decoding.

This study proposes a novel automated computerized framework for proficient identification of motor and mental imagery (MeI) EEG tasks by employing empirical Fourier decomposition (EFD) and improved EFD (IEFD) methods. Specifically, the multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is rendered to denoise EEG data first, and then, EFD is utilized to decompose nonstationary EEG into subsequent modes, while the IEFD criterion is proposed for a single conspicuous mode selection. Finally, the time- and frequency-domain features are extracted and classified with a feedforward neural network (FFNN) classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on four multichannel motor and MeI data sets from BCI competitions II and III using a tenfold cross-validation strategy. Results compared with the other existing methods demonstrated that the highest classification accuracies of 99.82% (data set IV-a), 93.33% (data set IV-b), 91.96% (data set III), and 88.08% (data set V) in subject-specific scenarios, while 82.70% (data set IV-a) in the subject-independent framework are achieved for IEFD with FFNN classifiers collectively.

The channel selection method helps to remove task-independent EEG signals, thereby improving the performance of the BCI system. However, the brain regions associated with motor imagery in different subjects are not exactly same, and the method of channel selection depends on the feedback of classification results. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposed a new method of channel selection based on backward elimination and threshold. First, we calculated the variance of channels between categories based on the covariance matrix. The backward selection and threshold selection methods were then used to retain the highly differentiated channels. We also used different criterion to evaluate the discriminability between different classes. The selected EEG signals used common spatial pattern (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) to calculate the classification accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed approach was examined using three data sets. The proposed approach has achieved 77.82% accuracy on the BCI Competition IV data set IIa, 86.02% accuracy on the BCI Competition III data set IIIa, and 86.86% accuracy on the binary class BCI Competition III data set IVa. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with other existing algorithms. The results of our experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm produces a higher classification accuracy compared to the other algorithms using lesser number of channels.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313336","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313336","Channel Selection;Similarity Measurement;Motor Imagery;EEG component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Covariance matrices;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Euclidean distance;Classification algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Electrodes","","9","","40","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, collection and labelling of additional target data is resource intensive. Furthermore, there may exist significant signal variations across time especially across multiple recording sessions which can result in model performance deterioration following adaptation. This introduces another challenging problem to training classifiers as they are typically unable to automatically determine which data is suitable for fine-tuning purposes, leading to some subjects facing performance drops even after adaptation. To address the data scarcity and variability in adaptive performance, we propose a novel machine-relearning Siamese architecture which utilizes few samples of unlabeled evaluation data to perform data efficient model re-learning. Machine re-learning optimally selects a sub-section of previously known data to update the model parameters. This is implemented via the use of comparative contrastive loss between the Gaussian distributions of target and known data to perform data selection. The highest subject-independent performance achieved an average (N=54) accuracy of 86.63% (±11.79%) without additional data and 88.23% (±10.36%) when utilizing a single unlabeled supplementary data for two-class motor imagery.

For people who are paralysed, BCI acts as an interface to control and regulate external devices and replaces their lost motor functionality, using brain activity alone. A motor imagery BCI translates a person's imagination about a movement into control signals which in turn controls the intended device. For this, the EEG signals that are produced according to the motor imaging need to be processed and analysed using various signal processing algorithms. During a motor activity, only the sensorimotor rhythms, which are the μ and β rhythms, get activated. Wavelet decomposition, which could provide both frequency and time localization, is employed to extract the sensorimotor rhythms. Since different brain regions are dependent during an activity, the correlation between the EEG channels must also be considered during the extraction of features. For this, Bayesian Network approach is used to obtain the maximum probable channels during each motor activity. Most of the BCI systems are subject specific systems. The proposed system uses Artificial Neural Network for feature classification and is a multi-user BCI with increased accuracy, which can be an adaptive system for multiple users.","","978-1-5090-6106-8","10.1109/ICICICT1.2017.8342691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8342691","Artificial Neural Network;Bayesian Network;Brain Computer Interface;Naive Bayes classifier;Wavelet Decomposition","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Bayes methods;Wavelet transforms;Brain-computer interfaces;Artificial neural networks","","17","","10","IEEE","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, auxiliary branch loss is leveraged for intermediate supervision to ensure the effective integration of CNNs and Transformers. Results: The performance of MSVTNet was assessed through subject-dependent (session-dependent and session-independent) and subject-independent experiments on three MI datasets, i.e., the BCI competition IV 2a, 2b and OpenBMI datasets.

Motor imagery (MI) is one well-known basis for designing Electroencephalography (EEG)-based real-life BCI systems. However, EEG signals are often contaminated with severe noise and various uncertainties, imprecise and incomplete information streams. Therefore, this study proposes spectrum ensemble based on swam-optimized fuzzy integral for integrating decisions from sub-band classifiers that are established by a sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. Firstly, the SBCSP effectively extracts features from EEG signals, and thereby the multiple linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) is employed during a MI classification task. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to regulate the subject-specific parameters for assigning optimal confidence levels for classifiers used in the fuzzy integral during the fuzzy fusion stage of the proposed system. Moreover, BCI systems usually tend to have complex architectures, be bulky in size, and require time-consuming processing. To overcome this drawback, a wireless and wearable EEG measurement system is investigated in this study. Finally, in our experimental result, the proposed system is found to produce significant improvement in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a robotic arm can be reliably controlled using the proposed BCI system.

Nowadays, inspired by the success of deep learning in computer vision and speech recognition applications, scientific researchers take advantages of convolutional networks to recognize EEG motion intention with superior performance. Although the accuracy of methods based on convolutional networks can reach or exceed that of traditional machine learning methods, it is still not high enough to guarantee widespread application, especially in complex tasks, like multi-dimension motion intention recognition.

In existing methods based on CSP, the spatial filters are extracted from the whole EEG signal as one time segment. In this study we use the fact that ERD/ERS events are not steady over time. This means that the importance of EEG channels vary for different time segments. Therefore we divide EEG signals into a number of time segments. Then we extract a feature vector from each time segment using CSP. We use OVR (One-Versus-the Rest) algorithm to break four classes problem into two classes problems. The considered four classes MI are left hand, right hand, foot and tongue. We used dataset 2a of BCI competition IV to evaluate our method. The result of experiment shows that this method outperforms both CSP and the best competitor of the BCI competition IV.

Because of this disadvantage, it is difficult to ensure adequate reliability compared to their high performance. In this study, we propose an explainable deep learning model aimed at classifying EEG signal which is obtained from the motor-imagery (MI) task.

We visualized the heatmap which indicates the output of the LRP in the form of topography to certify neuro-physiological factors. Furthermore, we classified EEG in the subject-independent manner to learn robust and generalized EEG features by avoiding subject dependency.

Feature extraction methods such as Hilbert Transform (HT) for taste, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) for odor, and HT for motor imagery were applied.

The most popular features are band power of EEG signals in frequency sub-bands in a relatively wide frequency band (e. g., 8–30 Hz) in different time windows of imagination period. The effectiveness of these features is highly dependent on the sub-bands and time windows adopted, since the optimal sub-bands and time windows is generally subject-specific. The nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is an excellent classifier for MI classification. In this paper, the SVM with an anisotropic Gaussian kernel with a scaling coefficient for each feature is used, instead of one scale factor for all features. The scaling coefficients are tuned by maximizing the kernel-target alignment criterion with $l_{l}$ regularization. Some of the scaling coefficients will be zero after maximization due to $l_{l}$ regularization, that is equivalent to removing corresponding irrelevant features from classification processes. Therefore, an embedded feature selection is also done to remove the destructive effect of irrelevant and redundant features. The average accuracy of the SVM classifier with anisotropic Gaussian kernel for four subjects in BCI IV-1 dataset is about 10% more than the SVM with isotropic Gaussian kernel.","2642-9527","979-8-3503-1256-0","10.1109/ICEE59167.2023.10334784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10334784","Brain-computer interface (BCI);Electroencephalogram (EEG);Motor imagery (Ml);Support vector machine (SVM);Kernel-target alignment (KTA);Embedded feature selection;l1 regularization;minibatch proximal gradient ascent","Support vector machines;Training;Scalp;Redundancy;Support vector machine classification;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography","","","","10","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To study correlates of these tasks, the researchers often employ neural data recorded from the subjects as they perform motor tasks using their dominant hand. In this study, we investigate the distinction between EEG spectral features during unilateral right and unilateral left, imagined and executed hand motor tasks. The analysis is conducted for the data from each hand separately, with the objective to identify whether the EEG activity that distinguished unilateral motor tasks is distinct for each hand. Further, a novel approach of selection of multichannel EEG spectral features is proposed and supervised classification based on support vector machines is employed to classify unilateral motor imagination and motor execution tasks using the selected features. Grand averages of spectral features, over 10 subjects, are studied and it is observed that EEG activity during unilateral motor tasks are both spatially localized and lateralized.

However, for the cursor movement control paradigm, it remains unclear as to how many channels should be selected in order to achieve the optimal classification.

Our results indicated that for the former dataset, the more channels we used, the higher the accuracy rate was achieved, which is in contrast to the finding in the latter dataset that optimal performance was obtained at a subset number of channels.

To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) based channel attention MLP-Mixer network (S-CAMLP-Net) for MI decoding with EEG. Specifically, a new EEG slice prediction task is designed as the pretext task to capture the long-range information of EEG trials in the time domain. In the downstream task, a newly proposed MLP-Mixer is applied to the classification task for signals rather than for images. Moreover, in order to effectively learn the discriminative spatial representations in EEG slices, an attention mechanism is integrated into MLP-Mixer to adaptively estimate the importance of each EEG channel without any prior information. Thus, the proposed S-CAMLP-Net can effectively learn more long-range temporal information and global spatial features of EEG signals.

The single trial, single channel eye-moving assisted motor imagery EEG and simply motor imagery EEG are acquired. Various types of eye-moving assisted EEG can be distinguished visually. The nonlinear features of various EEG are detected and analyzed. The results show that the nonlinear features of eye-moving assisted motor imagery EEG are more significance.","","978-1-4244-6712-9","10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5554123","EEG;acquisition;feature detection","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Prosthetics;Biomedical engineering;Robots;Brain computer interfaces;Conferences","","2","","","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Near infrared probes were aligned with C3 and C4, and EEG electrodes were placed midway between the NIRS probes. NIRS and EEG signals were acquired from six healthy subjects during six imagined hand clenching force and speed tasks involving the right hand. The results showed that NIRS combined with EEG is effective for simultaneously measuring brain activity of the sensorimotor area. The study also showed that in the duration of (0, 10) s for imagined force and speed of hand clenching, HbO first exhibited a negative variation trend, which was followed by a negative peak. After the negative peak, it exhibited a positive variation trend with a positive peak about 6-8 s after termination of imagined movement. During (-2, 1) s, the EEG may have indicated neural processing during the preparation, execution, and monitoring of a given imagined force and speed of hand clenching. The instantaneous phase, frequency, and amplitude feature of the EEG were calculated by Hilbert transform; HbO and the difference between HbO and Hb concentrations were extracted. The features of NIRS and EEG were combined to classify three levels of imagined force [at 20/50/80% MVGF (maximum voluntary grip force)] and speed (at 0.5/1/2 Hz) of hand clenching by SVM. The average classification accuracy of the NIRS-EEG fusion feature was 0.74 ± 0.02.

It has been reported that the use of kernel NMF (KNMF) is a particularly feasible way to extract the features of a motor-imagery related EEG spectrum, which is often used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). A BCI system enables users to control electrical devices without their hands or feet, and often requests to tell user's intention from motor-imagery related EEG features. In other words, a classification of the EEG signals reflecting the user's intentions is required. In this research, a constraint is placed on the KNMF to increase the discriminability between two classes, widening the difference between their spectral EEG energies. To evaluate the proposed method, the IDIAP database, which contains the motor-imagery related EEG spectrum of three subjects, was adopted for the discrimination between two classes. As a result, the classification accuracy when using the proposed constraint was approximately 78% on average, which is 4% higher than that obtained by KNMF without a constraint.","","978-1-4799-3211-5","10.1109/SITIS.2013.156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727306","Kernel nonnegative matrix factorization;Feature extraction;EEG;Brain-computer interfaces","Electroencephalography;Matrix decomposition;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Kernel;Databases;Dictionaries","","4","","11","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, no study has investigated feasibility of the BCI framework incorporating both intracortical and scalp signals. Methods: Concurrent local field potential (LFP) from the hand-knob area and scalp EEG were recorded in a paraplegic patient undergoing a spike-based close-loop neurorehabilitation training. Based upon multimodal spatio-spectral feature extraction and Naïve Bayes classification, we developed, for the first time, a novel LFP-EEG-BCI for motor intention decoding. A transfer learning (TL) approach was employed to further improve the feasibility. The performance of the proposed LFP-EEG-BCI for four-class upper-limb motor intention decoding was assessed. Results: Using a decision fusion strategy, we showed that the LFP-EEG-BCI significantly (p $< $ 0.05) outperformed single modal BCI (LFP-BCI and EEG-BCI) in terms of decoding accuracy with the best performance achieved using regularized common spatial pattern features. Interrogation of feature characteristics revealed discriminative spatial and spectral patterns, which may lead to new insights for better understanding of brain dynamics during different motor imagery tasks and promote development of efficient decoding algorithms. Moreover, we showed that similar classification performance could be obtained with few training trials, therefore highlighting the efficacy of TL. Conclusion: The present findings demonstrated the superiority of the novel LFP-EEG-BCI in motor intention decoding. Significance: This work introduced a novel LFP-EEG-BCI that may lead to new directions for developing practical neurorehabilitation systems with high detection accuracy and multi-paradigm feasibility in clinical applications.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2021.3115799","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:81801785,82172056); Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019KE0AD01); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020FZZX01-005); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0701400); Zhejiang University Global Partnership(grant numbers:100000-11320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551784","Brain computer interface;motor imagery;common spatial pattern;transfer learning;rehabilitation","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Decoding;Elbow;Training;Calibration;Sun","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Neurological Rehabilitation","23","","65","IEEE","28 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, most artifact removal models fail to ensure semantic consistency, rendering them ineffective. To solve it, we propose an artifact removal model based on the 1-dimensional diffusion model utilizing the U-Net, referred to as Essentia.

To address this problem, we propose a Multi-level Spatial-Temporal Adaptation Network (MSTAN), extracting domain-invariant multi-level spatial-temporal features to overcome domain differences. First, stacked spatial-temporal graph convolution (STGCN) layers and an attention-based readout module are designed to extract spatial-temporal patterns of EEGs at multiple levels. An adaptation scheme is then introduced to narrow domain differences: 1) Individual graph parameters for the source and target domains are designed at each STGCN layer to capture the domain-specific brain region dynamic relationships; 2) The differences of spatial-temporal features between the source and target domain are reduced by minimizing the distribution distance. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method on a public dataset and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain motor imagery classification.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9746123","Motor Imagery;STGCN;Domain Adaptation","Adaptation models;Convolution;Conferences;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Acoustics","","3","","18","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An EEG Motor Imagery Classification for BCI is a specific application of EEG in which brain signals directly related to motor imagery tasks are analyzed and classified to control external devices or applications, namely robotic systems or computers.

Most BCI systems are based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and within this group, systems using motor imagery (MI) are amongst the most flexible. However, for stroke patients, the motor areas of the brain are not always available for use in these types of devices. The aim of this work was to evaluate a set of imagery-based cognitive tasks (right-hand MI versus music imagery, with rest or “blank” periods in between), using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and EEG. Eleven healthy subjects (control group) and four stroke patients were evaluated with fMRI, and nine of the healthy subjects also underwent an EEG test. The fMRI results for the control group showed specific and statistically differentiable activation patterns for motor versus music imagery (t-test, p <; 0.001). For stroke patients the fMRI results showed a very large variability, with no common activation pattern for either of the imagery tasks. Corroborating this fact, EEG results concerning feature selection for minimizing the classification error (using the Davies-Bouldin index) have also found no common activation pattern, although a well-defined set of meaningful electrodes and frequencies was found for some subjects. In terms of classification performance using EEG data, this work has detected a group of subjects with classifier rate of success up to 60%, which is promising in view of the cognitive complexity of the adopted tasks.","2326-7844","978-1-4673-3025-1","10.1109/BRC.2013.6487494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487494","brain-computer interfaces;BCI;motor imagery;music imagery;fMRI;electroencephalography","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Indexes;Training;Multiple signal classification;Time series analysis;Density measurement","","3","","25","IEEE","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In essence, it allows a person to control external equipment by decoding EEG signals during the mental imagery of limb movements. However, due to the intricate individual variances in EEG signals, creating a general decoding model with parameters applicable to all subjects is exceptionally challenging. Consequently, a prolonged calibration process is necessary to gather labeled subject-specific data for each individual, making it less user-friendly. A potential solution to this problem is transfer learning, a methodology that transfers knowledge from related domains to a target domain. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a novel transfer learning approach on the Riemannian manifold framework in the context of multiclass MI EEG-based BCI classification. Particularly, a user-specific frequency band selection (FBS) method with MI EEG class distinctiveness is utilized to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Riemannian space calculations, which is measured using the inter-class distance and intra-class variance on the manifold. Then, the Riemannian space Alignment (RA) strategy is used to calibrate the MI EEG variances of different subjects. The comparative experiments between the proposed approach and baseline/conventional methods are conducted on a public dataset with four-class motor imagery EEG, including two-class transfer learning scenario and four-class transfer learning scenario. proposed transfer learning approach is outperformed. Compared with the baseline/conventional methods using a fixed wide frequency band, the preliminary results suggests that the proposed approach can significantly improve the transfer learning performance for the MI EEG signals from different subjects in Riemannian space.","2996-4164","979-8-3503-9191-6","10.1109/M2VIP62491.2024.10745999","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province; State Key Laboratory of Robotics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10745999","","Manifolds;Mechatronics;Machine vision;Transfer learning;Motors;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Frequency measurement;Decoding","","","","25","IEEE","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A step towards assisting such patients is to correctly classify their EEG signals collected while the patients imagine or perform hand/finger movements. This work considers using the tripolar electroencephalography (tEEG) instead of the traditional EEG due to higher signal-to-noise (SNR), better spatial resolution, better artifact noise rejection feature, and ability to capture high-frequency features of tEEG, compared to conventional EEG. In this paper, we compare the performance of tEEG and EEG signals in classifying motor imagery (MI) of right and left index fingers by using a deep learning algorithm: convolutional neural network (CNN).

Here, we introduce an enhanced feature extraction method that combines Joint label-Common and label-Specific Feature Exploration (JCSFE) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to explore microstate features. First, GMMs are employed to represent the smooth transitions of EEG spatiotemporal features within microstate models. Second, category-common and category-specific features are identified by applying regularization constraints to linear classifiers. Third, a graph regularizer is used to extract subject-invariant microstate features.

However, the amount of raw EEG data is often limited. Raw EEG data contains significant noise caused by individual and task-specific differences. These complications often necessitate the removal of noise, making it crucial to develop robust models capable of maintaining performance. To achieve this, synthetic data is essential to obtain cleaner signals. This paper presents a novel a novel contrastive diffusion model to adaptive synthesize clean signals for Motor Imagery Classification (CDASC-MI), achieved through three components: Clean Signal Extractor(CSE) for clean signal feature learning, Adapative Noise Extractor(ANE) for adaptively extracting subject noise and task noise, and Contrastive Module for further separating noise to obtain cleaner signals.

Many of these scenarios utilize the concept of embodiment, or one's observation of another entity to be a part of oneself, to improve practice quality of the imagined body movement. We therefore hypothesized that applying immersive virtual reality headsets, with their ability to provide rich immersion and illusion by presenting egocentrically simulated virtual scenarios, and action observation to motor imagery practice will result in significant improvement. To explore the possible synergy between immersive systems and motor imagery, we analyzed the electroencephalogram signals of our participants as they were presented the same virtual hand movement scenario with two different mediums: an immersive virtual reality headset and a monitor display. Our experimental results provide evidence that the immersive virtual reality headsets induced improved rhythmic patterns with better discriminating spatial features from the brain compared to the monitor display.

In this work, we investigated the classification of EEG eye state data using statistical and CSP filter technique. Statistical feature has been applied in EEG signal classifications of eye-close and eye-open conditions but the accuracy is reported to be less than 78%. CSP filter is a well-known method for classification of motor imagery EEG in the BCI field but when applied for EEG eye state classification, it only gives accuracy similar to statistical feature, that is less than 78%. These indicate that both methods give good discrimination of the eye state condition but on it own, will not be sufficient to produce good classification accuracy. Hence, this work aims to develop an algorithm using statistical-CSP feature for eye state classification from EEG signal. This is taking advantage on the discriminative feature provided by both methods, statistical and CSP filter, which is expected to increase the accuracy of the eye state classification algorithm. The process of developing the EEG eye state classification algorithm, includes data extraction, pre-processing, data normalization, feature extraction, feature selection and classification are detailed out in this paper.

Furthermore, preparation of EEG monitoring equipment and making proper contact between skin and electrodes is a tedious and time-consuming task due to presence of hair and different skull shapes. In this paper, we report the experimental attempts on improving the accuracy of EEG acquisition using a semi-invasive approach which utilizes acupuncture-based needle penetration to alleviate the effect of sculpt on the EEG signals and enhance the preparation efficiency. High level cluster analysis and low level signal analysis on real-life data recorded for nine physical, lingual, and motor imagery tasks suggest that contrary to our expectations, the proposed method is not effective.","","978-1-4799-7495-5","10.1109/IWW-BCI.2015.7073048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073048","EEG;Acupuncture;Cluster Analysis","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Needles;Headphones;Noise;Brain;Scalp","","","","9","IEEE","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, we develop a novel domain adaptation method with optimal transport and frequency mixup for cross-subject transfer learning in motor imagery BCIs. Specifically, the preprocessed EEG signals from source and target domain are mapped into latent space with an embedding module, where the representation distributions and label distributions across domains have a large discrepancy. We assume that there exists a non-linear coupling matrix between both domains, which can be utilized to estimate the distance of joint distributions for different domains. Depending on the optimal transport, the Wasserstein distance between source and target domains is minimized, yielding the alignment of joint distributions. Moreover, a new mixup strategy is also introduced to generalize the model, where the inputs trials are mixed in frequency domain rather than in raw space. The extensive experiments on three evaluation benchmarks are conducted to validate the proposed framework.

As the EEG signals have noise and overfitting issues, various regularized CSP algorithms are introduced to overcome these factors. In this work, a method is introduced to find the variant of CSP that achieves maximum classification accuracy with least number of EEG channels. The approach is based on firstly identify the spatial filter weights using complete set of channels. In the next step, the channels are selected based on the maximal filter weights. Channels with highest values are included to find the accuracy in next run and ultimately the optimum combination of number of channels, CSP variant and classification accuracy are reported.

In this sense, methods that assume uncorrelatedness of the sources become inaccurate. Therefore, we are promoting a new methodology that considers both volume conduction effect and signal propagation between multiple brain regions.

In this study, we present a novel feature extraction method termed Spectrum-weighted Tensor Discriminant Analysis (SwTDA), which optimizes spectral filters along with spatial filters and other associated patterns by tensor-based discriminant analysis. The proposed method considers intrinsic spatial-spectral-temporal information contained by the physiological signal and hence can identify discriminative characteristics robustly.

Although numerous BCI studies have successfully decoded large body parts, such as the movement intention of both hands, arms, or legs, research on MI decoding of high-level behaviors such as hand grasping is essential to further expand the versatility of MI-based BCIs. In this study, we propose NeuroGrasp, a dual-stage deep learning framework that decodes multiple hand grasping from EEG signals under the MI paradigm. The proposed method effectively uses an EEG and electromyography (EMG)-based learning, such that EEG-based inference at test phase becomes possible. The EMG guidance during model training allows BCIs to predict hand grasp types from EEG signals accurately. Consequently, NeuroGrasp improved classification performance offline, and demonstrated a stable classification performance online. Across 12 subjects, we obtained an average offline classification accuracy of 0.68 (±0.09) in four-grasp-type classifications and 0.86 (±0.04) in two-grasp category classifications. In addition, we obtained an average online classification accuracy of 0.65 (±0.09) and 0.79 (±0.09) across six high-performance subjects.

The spatial covariance matrix of EEG signals is a feature with many applications on brain-computer interfaces. Several previous works use EEG covariances directly as inputs to Riemannian classifiers for MI decoding, restricting the potential models that can be used for classification, to Riemannian geometry frameworks. Other works use covariances either as inputs to optimization objectives that derive spatial filters, or to perform alignment with respect to reference states. Such methods discard temporal information that is contained in EEG signals. We take a different approach, and utilize covariances as a means to concurrently align EEG signals and regularize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained on MI classification. Specifically, we randomly mix session-level and trial-level co-variance matrices, traversing their geodesic on the Riemannian manifold, and perform EEG signal alignment using the mixed matrix. This is done during the training phase, effectively acting as regularization on the CNN model, as the signals are augmented using various transformation matrices to align them.

The objective of this research is primarily on improving neurological rehabilitation. The complexity and non-linearity of electroencephalogram (EEG) data present challenges for conventional signal processing techniques. The present study addresses these challenges by analyzing the dynamic nature of EEG signals. The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) method is used non-recursively to decompose the EEG signals into four different band-limited intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), specifically IMFs $8,9,10$, and 11. To reduce computational load and enhance system performance, 16 motor-cortex-based channels are chosen from a total of $\mathbf{1 1 8}$ channels. Approximate entropy and sample entropy are computed from the IMFs to form a feature vector. This generated feature vector is then fed into different classification algorithms such as LDA, SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes for classification. The highest average accuracy achieved across all classifiers using approximate entropy is $100 \%$ and corresponding F 1 score are $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}, \mathbf{9 5. 3 5 \%}$, $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}, \mathbf{9 7. 5 0 \%}$ respectively, while the sample entropy feature yields classification performances of $\mathbf{9 8. 7 5 \%}, \mathbf{9 9. 3 8 \%}, \mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$, $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$ and corresponding F1 score are $\mathbf{9 9. 3 5 \%}, \mathbf{9 8. 7 1 \%}, \mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$, $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$ respectively. VMD allows for more accurate decomposition of the signal for precise analysis. Both ApEn and SampEn yield state-of-the-art results when applied to the decomposed signals.

The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2920748","Center For Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS⁲B) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-009-150); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730362","Brain computer interface;motor imagery;steady-state visual evoked potential;electroencephalography;channel reduction;common frequency pattern","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Visualization;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Electrodes;Brain","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Female;Fourier Analysis;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Imagination;Male;Psychomotor Performance;Recognition, Psychology;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","22","","47","IEEE","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite extensive research dedicated to MI EEG classification algorithms, a notable deficiency still remains: their performance is often optimal only in subject-specific or dataset-specific scenarios, which undermines their generalization capability, hence restricting BCI systems' practical utility in real-world contexts. To address this limitation, this study introduces a cutting-edge approach: a discriminative adversarial network based on spatial-temporal-graph fusion (STG-DAN). This innovation aims to learn features that are not only class-discriminative but also domain-invariant. Specifically, the feature extraction module guarantees the feature discriminativeness by amalgamating spatial-temporal and graph-related features, while the domain alignment module focuses on both global domain and local subdomain. The two modules are incorporated into one adversarial learning framework to facilitate the acquisition of domain-invariant features. Evaluations on two publicly accessible datasets, BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI, affirm the superiority of our proposed model (averaged accuracy = 62.94% and 73.01% for the two datasets in cross-subject circumstance, respectively).

However, the current decoding methods based on deep learning are still dominated by single-scale serial convolution, which leads to insufficient extraction of abundant information from motor imagery signals. To overcome such challenges, we propose a new end-to-end convolutional neural network based on multiscale spatial-temporal feature fusion (MSTFNet) for EEG classification of motor imagery.

Moreover, we implement a straightforward yet potent data augmentation strategy to bolster the performance of MSTFNet significantly. To validate the performance of MSTFNet, we conduct cross-session experiments and leave-one-subject-out experiments.

EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, which can be used to decode user intentions. Because the feature space of EEG data is highly dimensional and signal patterns are specific to the subject, appropriate methods for feature representation are required to enhance the decoding accuracy of the CNN model. Furthermore, neural changes exhibit high variability between sessions, subjects within a single session, and trials within a single subject, resulting in major issues during the modeling stage. In addition, there are many subject-dependent factors, such as frequency ranges, time intervals, and spatial locations at which the signal occurs, which prevent the derivation of a robust model that can achieve the parameterization of these factors for a wide range of subjects. However, previous studies did not attempt to preserve the multivariate structure and dependencies of the feature space. In this study, we propose a method to generate a spatiospectral feature representation that can preserve the multivariate information of EEG data. Specifically, 3-D feature maps were constructed by combining subject-optimized and subject-independent spectral filters and by stacking the filtered data into tensors. In addition, a layer-wise decomposition model was implemented using our 3-D-CNN framework to secure reliable classification results on a single-trial basis. The average accuracies of the proposed model were 87.15% (±7.31), 75.85% (±12.80), and 70.37% (±17.09) for the BCI competition data sets IV_2a, IV_2b, and OpenBMI data, respectively. These results are better than those obtained by state-of-the-art techniques, and the decomposition model obtained the relevance scores for neurophysiologically plausible electrode channels and frequency domains, confirming the validity of the proposed approach.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3048385","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) Grant, funded through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2015-0-00185); Development of Intelligent Pattern Recognition Softwares for Ambulatory Brain Computer Interface(grant numbers:2017-0-00451); Development of BCI based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions using Deep Learning(grant numbers:2019-0-00079); Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program, Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325918","Brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);electroencephalography (EEG);explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);motor imagery (MI)","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Mutual information;Decoding;Feature extraction;Probability;Entropy","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Neuroimaging","99","","48","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, leveraging deep learning (DL) models for MI decoding is challenged by the difficulty of accessing user-specific MI-EEG data on large scales. Simulated MI-EEG signals can be useful to address these issues, providing well-defined data for the validation of decoding models and serving as a data augmentation approach to improve the training of DL models. While substantial efforts have been dedicated to implementing effective data augmentation strategies and model-based EEG signal generation, the simulation of neurophysiologically plausible EEG-like signals has not yet been exploited in the context of data augmentation. Furthermore, none of the existing approaches have integrated user-specific neurophysiological information during the data generation process. Here, we present PySimMIBCI, a framework for generating realistic MI-EEG signals by integrating neurophysiologically meaningful activity into biophysical forward models. By means of PySimMIBCI, different user capabilities to control an MI-BCI can be simulated and fatigue effects can be included in the generated EEG.

Therefore, recent research has focused on decoding human intentions from EEG signals utilizing deep learning methods. However, since EEG signals are highly susceptible to noise during acquisition, there is a high possibility of the existence of noisy data in the dataset. Although pioneer studies have generally assumed that the dataset is well-curated, this assumption is not always met in the EEG dataset. In this paper, we addressed this issue by designing a dataset refinement algorithm that can eliminate noisy data based on metrics evaluating data influence during the training process. We applied the proposed algorithm to two motor imagery EEG public datasets and three different models to perform dataset refinement. The results indicated that retraining the model with the refined dataset consistently led to better generalization performance compared to using the original dataset.

It plays a key role in prosthesis control and motor rehabilitation. To improve user comfort, preserve data privacy, and reduce the system’s latency, a new trend in wearable BMIs is to execute algorithms on low-power microcontroller units (MCUs) embedded on edge devices to process the electroencephalographic (EEG) data in real-time close to the sensors. However, most of the classification models presented in the literature are too resource-demanding for low-power MCUs. This article proposes an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) for EEG-based MI classification that achieves comparable accuracy while being orders of magnitude less resource-demanding and significantly more energy-efficient than state-of-the-art (SoA) models. To further reduce the model complexity, we propose an automatic channel selection method based on spatial filters and quantize both weights and activations to 8-bit precision with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, we implement and evaluate the proposed models on leading-edge parallel ultralow-power (PULP) MCUs.

To our best knowledge, the Inception architecture in DL is combined with a domain adaptation (DA) scheme for the first time for the MI classification task. The approach contains two compact Inception blocks that decode temporal features in different scales. In addition, we jointly optimize a novel combined loss function to reduce both marginal and class conditional discrepancies caused by the multimodal structure of EEG signals. The DA-based loss enables Inception blocks to take full advantage of their learning abilities to capture discriminative patterns of MI data from multiple subjects instead of relying on the target user only. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct substantial experiments on two well-known data sets, brain–computer interface competition IV-2a and competition IV-2b.

The model provides accuracy of 81.8 %, sensitivity of 0.8906, specificity of 0.7485 and precision of 0.7721. Some more confusion matrix-based performance parameters have also been calculated to check the performance of the proposed method and to compare it with the existing techniques. This method provides good performance with four channel datasets used in this research. Whereas previous research uses higher channel EEG devices for data recording. Hence, the suggested approach could one day replace bulky higher channel devices as small devices are easy to use and cost effective. People who suffer from speech impairments may be provided with portable devices to communicate with the external world with more comfort.","","979-8-3503-5561-1","10.1109/ICAET63349.2025.10932161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10932161","EEG;Speech Imagery Task;Non-Invasive EEG Devices;Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks","Performance evaluation;Electrodes;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Imaging;Motors;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Recording;Convolutional neural networks","","","","27","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By investigating this point, we hope to understand which spectral components are related to MI ""literacy"". Twelve healthy subjects performed a neurofeedback task whereby a cursor was moved to one of two targets (left and right) using only motor imagery of the corresponding hands. To evaluate the effect of aptitude, we measured the Mahalanobis' distances between whole-scalp spectral patterns in four frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) during the first session of left and right motor imagery. Later, we used these features as inputs in a Support Vector Regressor to predict performance during the following two sessions. The performance was measured as the percentage of trials where the cursor correctly reached the target. Since our sample was balanced, this approach predicted performance on sessions two and three with mean absolute errors of 15.07±12.94% and 11.98±11.40%, respectively. The most relevant feature in both cases was the Mahalanobis' distance in alpha. These results suggest that participants who can not evoke different patterns of alpha power during left- and right-hand motor imagery during the first session, also are less likely to improve during the following training sessions. The investigation of whole-scalp differences allows a holistic comprehension of the neural basis of motor imagery.

However, the time window and frequency band of the ERD/ERS pattern activated by motor imagery vary from person to person. In this study, we propose a power spectrum pattern difference-based time-frequency sub-band selection (PSPD) method, which can further improve the classification performance of MI EEG. To better analyze the sensorimotor rhythm, we divide the EEG channels and extract the average and maximum pattern difference of the power spectrum according to the division. Then, the difference metric of the power spectrum pattern difference of inter-sample sets is calculated by dynamic time warping distance, and the consistency metric of the power spectrum pattern difference of intra-sample sets is calculated by mean pooling, and the optimal time-frequency sub-band is selected based on these two metrics. Finally, the optimal time-frequency sub-bands are respectively used for the common spatial pattern feature extraction and the linear kernel support vector machine classification. The proposed PSPD method achieves an average classification accuracy of 84.51%, 84.10% and 73.21% in BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa, Dataset IIb and OpenBMI dataset, respectively.

To extract the discriminative features and alleviate overfitting problem for motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI), spatial filtering is widely applied but often only very few common spatial patterns (CSP) are selected as features while ignoring all others. However, using only few CSP features, though alleviates overfitting problem, loses the discriminating information, which limits the BCI performance. This letter proposes a novel feature weighting and regularization (FWR) method that utilizes all CSP features to avoid information loss. The proposed method can be applied in all CSP-based approaches. Experiments of this letter show the effect of the proposed method applied in the standard CSP and its two extensions, common spatio-spectral patterns and regularized CSP.

Especially, in brain computer interface (BCI) research, around 3.5s-long motor imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) samples are needed to obtain satisfactory classification performance. This time-span requirement of the training samples makes real-time MI BCI systems impossible to implement based on deep networks, which restricts the related researches within laboratory and makes practical application hard to accomplish. To address this issue, a double-point observation deep network (DoNet) is developed to classify ultra-short samples buried in noise. First, an analytical solution is developed theoretically to perform ultra-short signal classification based on double-point couples. Then, a signal-noise model is constructed to study the interference of noise on classification based on double-point couples. Based on which, an independent identical distribution condition is utilized to improve the classification accuracy in a data-driven manner. Combining the theoretical model and data-driven mechanism, DoNet can construct a steady data-distribution for the double-point couples of the samples with the same label. Therefore, the conditional probability of each double-point couple of a test sample can be obtained. With a voting strategy, the samples can be accurately classified by fusing these conditional probabilities. Meanwhile, the noise interference can be suppressed. DoNet has been evaluated on two public EEG datasets.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) systems can be defined to be a non-muscular pathway to operate rehabilitative devices using motor imagery signals captured from the motor activation areas in the brain. Supervised learning can help in prediction of motor imagery actions by processing raw EEG signals. However, dimension of the feature space plays a crucial role in this process. Large dimensional features not only increase the computational complexity but also the presence of redundant features causes reduction in classification accuracy. In this work, we intend to select the relevant features from the feature vector obtained by Power Spectrum Density estimation of the left/right motor imagery signals. BCI Competition 2008 - Graz dataset B has been used as the source of raw EEG data. To achieve this goal, we have used single-objective as well as many-objective version of Differential Evolution which optimizes the classifier's performance in terms of five metrics obtained from the Confusion Matrix. Support Vector Machine is used for fitness evaluation of the chosen feature subset as well as for classification of mental states. This work demonstrates the superiority of many-objective Differential Evolution in improving the accuracy due to reduction in feature dimension from an average of 60.56% to 82.60% while processing time of a test EEG sample reduces from 6.1 milliseconds to 5.6 milliseconds.

Additionally, complex classification techniques may have been proposed to enhance the accuracy of system but they may cause a notable delay during online applications. This paper investigated the application of neural network-based algorithms to classify three-class MIs by utilizing EEG time-domain features. Integrated EEG (IEEG) and Root Mean Square (RMS) features were extracted from EEG signals. Then, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks were employed to classify the features. The discrimination ratio of such features were examined and compared through different classifiers. Moreover, the robustness of classifiers was investigated and compared. The results of this study indicated that RMS was more capable than IEEG for characterizing MI movements and RBF was more accurate and faster than MLP. The effectiveness of IEEG and RMS features and the performance of MLP and RBF classifiers were compared with Willison Amplitude (WAMP) feature and support vector machine (SVM) classifier respectively. This study proved that WAMP and SVM were more efficient for classification of MI tasks in both terms of accuracy (88.96%) and training time (0.5 second); however, considerable difference was not observed since RBF performed as fast as SVM with only about 3% less accuracy.","","978-1-4799-2027-3","10.1109/TENCONSpring.2014.6863026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863026","Brain Computer Interface;Electroencephalogram;Motor Imagery;Time-Domain Feature;Classification","Feature extraction;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Electroencephalography;Training;Time-domain analysis;Classification algorithms","","49","","10","IEEE","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used to detect and classify MI tasks. However, the lack of annotated data hampers the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to address these challenges, as it allows models to be trained on decentralized datasets without exchanging data. This study proposes an FL approach for MI-EEG signal classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the PhysioNet dataset containing EEG recordings of left and right-hand imagery movements. We evaluate the performance of the FL approach using two different aggregation methods, namely FedAvg and FedProx, and compare it to the centralized ML approach. Furthermore, we explore the effect of increasing the number of clients who participate in the learning process on the performance of the model. Our findings demonstrate that FL maintains consistent classification accuracy comparable to the centralized ML approach while reducing data leakage risks. Thus, FL shows great promise as an essential instrument for MI-EEG signal classification and BCI systems, enabling distributed training of a comprehensive model when privacy-sensitive data is dispersed across multiple clients.","","979-8-3503-4647-3","10.1109/COINS57856.2023.10189325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189325","Motor Imagery (MI);Electroencephalography (EEG);Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Federated Learning (FL)","Training;Federated learning;Pattern classification;Distributed databases;Brain modeling;Data models;Electroencephalography","","3","","23","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Single-modal noninvasive brain signals have limitations, such as low spatial resolution or low temporal resolution, while multimodal brain signal acquisition and processing can overcome these limitations. Electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) is a method with advantages in multimodal brain signal processing, but current fusion methods mostly use manual feature extraction or channel selection, which may lead to the loss of important information during the feature extraction or channel selection process in real-time BCI systems. In order to solve this issue, this article proposes an innovative fusion analysis method for EEG-fNIRS multimodal brain signals, using a hybrid algorithm that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and Attention mechanisms for signal classification. The method first preprocesses the EEG and fNIRS signals separately, then extracts features using spatial-temporal convolutional layers, and finally merges them to obtain the classification results through dual attention calculation. Our method is validated on two publicly available mixed EEG-fNIRS BCI datasets, including three types of experimental tasks that do not involve actual movement: motor imagery (MI), mental arithmetic, and word generation (WG). The accuracy rates for each task reached 92.2% for MI, 98.6% for mental arithmetic, and 95.2% for WG, respectively. These rates have surpassed all the current methods. This indicates that our proposed method achieves better classification performance in non-actual movement classification tasks under the premise of lightweight. The method proposed in this study can be applied to the field of rapid and efficient identification of brain signals.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2025.3538086","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62303299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10886982","Attention;brain-computer interface (BCI);convolutional neural network (CNN);electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS);motor imagery (MI)","Feature extraction;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Data mining;Brain modeling;Training;Accuracy;Transformers;Optical variables measurement;Signal processing algorithms","","","","46","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently been widely used in EEG signal classification. However, EEG signals have complexity, dynamics, and low signal-to-noise ratio, and simple network frameworks are insufficient for complex MI-EEG classification tasks.

To improve information utilization, we propose a SincNet-based hybrid neural network (SHNN) for MI-based BCIs.

The resulting sparse data were fed into convolutional neural networks to learn deep feature representations. Finally, these deep features were fed into a gated recurrent unit module to seek sequential relations, and a fully connected layer was used for classification.

Therefore, this paper proposes an optimized recognition method based on temporal features and spatial features re-representation. The Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) algorithm is used to extract the Product Functions (PFs) of the Motor Imagery Electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signals and the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is applied to reconstruct the spatial distribution of each PF, then the MI-EEG signals are re-represented as features with temporal and spatial characteristics. The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is constructed, in which the smoothing factor is optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By introducing the PSO algorithm, the PNN can be adaptively determined according to the respective conditions of different subjects or datasets. The experimental results show, compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on feature re-representation and other state-of-the-art machine learning methods, the proposed method in this paper has both high recognition accuracy and adaptability. This optimized PNN with PSO method establishes a theoretical foundation and methodological guidance for the decoding of motor imagery recognition.","1948-9447","979-8-3503-3472-2","10.1109/CCDC58219.2023.10326560","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10326560","motor imagery recognition;probabilistic neural network;particle swarm optimization;optimization algorithm;feature re-representation","Support vector machines;Adaptation models;Time-frequency analysis;Image recognition;Smoothing methods;Computational modeling;Feature extraction","","","","15","IEEE","1 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vigilance detection has been an important topic in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. However, the study is limited due to the low SNR (Signal-Noise Ratio) nature of EEG. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a one of the most effective algorithms for feature extraction method in the BCI study area. The CSP seeks for an optimal projection direction (spatial filter) by maximizing the variance of one class and simultaneously minimizing the variance of the other class. There is one drawbacks exists in the traditional CSP, that is, the CSP is proposed relies on the assumption that data in each class follow the Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption is not always true for EEG data in practice, especially in the research of vigilance detection based EEG (e.g. during sleep). Thus, traditional CSP suffers performance degradation in case of non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we extend the traditional CSP to the general version and proposed nonparametric CSP (NCSP) algorithms which do not explicitly rely on the assumption of the underlying class Gaussian distribution and we then develop a new efficient algorithm based on matrix deflation to solve the proposed NCSP algorithm and its extensions-nonparametric multi-class CSP (NMCSP).

In this study, we propose an innovative approach for classifying multi-class MI-EEG signals, which consists of a signal processing technique based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multi-class common spatial patterns (MCCSP). Specifically, after applying the EMD, we propose selecting the best intrinsic mode functions (IMF) as the substitution to the original EEG signal for the next stage of processing. The metric we used for the selection is based on the cross-correlation of each decomposed IMF with the original signal. Next, we extend the CSP algorithm to the MCCSP to be utilized as the feature extractor. We applied our technique to the BCI competition IV (2a). Results revealed that the proposed technique improved classification accuracy significantly compared to the original case when applying MCCSP directly to the original EEG channel data. Moreover, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) achieved the highest mean classification accuracy rate of 91.28%. Our findings suggest that a promising elevated classification accuracy of 96.71% can be achieved by raising the feature dimension through MCCSP.

Approach: This paper proposes an end-to-end Filter-Bank Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (FBMSNet) for MI classification. A filter bank is first employed to derive a multiview spectral representation of the EEG data. Mixed depthwise convolution is then applied to extract temporal features at multiple scales, followed by spatial filtering to mitigate volume conduction.

However, the long-term task-based calibration required for enhanced model performance leads to an unfriendly user experience, while the inadequacy of EEG data hinders the performance of deep learning models. To address these challenges, a task-free transfer learning strategy (TFTL) for EEG-based cross-subject & cross-dataset MI-BCI is proposed for calibration time reduction and multi-center data co-modeling. Methods: TFTL strategy consists of data alignment, shared feature extractor, and specific classifiers, in which the label predictor for MI tasks classification, as well as domain and dataset discriminator for inter-subject variability reduction are concurrently optimized for knowledge transfer from subjects across different datasets to the target subject. Moreover, only resting data of the target subject is used for subject-specific model construction to achieve task-free. Results: We employed three deep learning methods (ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, and TCNet-Fusion) as baseline approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on five datasets (BCIC IV Dataset 2a, Dataset 1, Physionet MI, Dreyer 2023, and OpenBMI). The results demonstrate a significant improvement with the inclusion of the TFTL strategy compared to the baseline methods, reaching a maximum enhancement of 15.67% with a statistical significance (p = 2.4e-5 < 0.05). Moreover, task-free resulted in MI trials needed for calibration being 0 for all datasets, which significantly alleviated the calibration burden for patients before usage. Conclusion/Significance: The proposed TFTL strategy effectively addresses challenges posed by prolonged calibration periods and insufficient EEG data, thus promoting MI-BCI from laboratory to clinical application.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2024.3474049","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4706100,2022YFC3601100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62203440,62250058); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L232021); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2023QNRC001); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10704990","Electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery;transfer learning;task-free;cross-subject;cross-dataset","Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Transfer learning;Electroencephalography;Data models;Deep learning;Calibration;Accuracy;Training;Decoding","Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Imagination;Adult;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Deep Learning;Female;Young Adult;Algorithms","","","41","IEEE","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stroke patients recruited underwent 10 sessions of 1-hour BCI with robotic feedback for 2 weeks, 5 times a week. The analysis was performed by computing the coherences of the EEG in the lesion and contralesion side of the hemisphere from each session, and the coherence index of the lesion hemisphere (0 ≤ CI ≤ 1) was computed. The coherence index represents the rate of activation of the lesion hemisphere, and the correlation with the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) before and after the BCI therapy was investigated. Significant improvement in the FMA scores was reported for five of the six patients (p = 0.01).

In order to conduct the preprocessing of EEG more effectively, this paper focuses on the quantitative analysis of artifacts influence on the performance of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MIBCI). Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied firstly to separate the raw EEG signals into several independent components (ICs) so as to find artifact components. On this basis, the recognition accuracy before and after removing each artifact component were compared. Focusing on the influences of electro-oculogram (EOG), electromyography (EMG), power-line burst, and electrode artifacts, the comparison experiments were performed. The experimental results show that the accuracies obtained relative increments of 5.5%, 4.0%, 3.1%, and 1.7%, respectively, in terms of the order of EMG, power-line interference, electrode artifact, and EOG.

Although some prior works employed a normalization technique, the parameters were still derived from all sessions, not just the training sessions, resulting in low prediction accuracy in real-world online systems. In this paper, we propose an adjustment strategy that can be applied online to all features by subtracting ""estimated mean"" and dividing ""estimated interquartile rage"" (IQR) or ""estimated standard deviation"" (SD), which are obtaining by using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA).

This study proposes an approach for the evaluation of concentration for both during preparation and MI task, by monitoring attention level using before- and after-theta/beta ratio (TBR). In this endeavor, a total of 9 EEG recording was retrieved from BCI competition IV 2a dataset. Attention change index (ACI) was calculated before and after TBR. The classification performance was estimated from the EEGNet. For evaluating the correlation between ACI and accuracy, this study focused on the inter-hemispheric region (Fz, FCz, Cz) that is related to cognitive function. Data analyses showed that the ACI and classification accuracy had the highest positive correlation on FCz (r2=0.343).

This study is the first to thoroughly investigate the effects of EEG preprocessing in deep learning applications, drafting guidelines for future research. It evaluates the effects of varying preprocessing levels, from raw and minimally filtered data to complex pipelines with automated artifact removal algorithms. Six classification tasks (eye blinking, motor imagery, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s disease, sleep deprivation, and first episode psychosis) and four established EEG architectures were considered for the evaluation. The analysis of 4800 trained models revealed statistical differences between preprocessing pipelines at the intra-task level for each model and at the inter-task level for the largest model. Models trained on raw data consistently performed poorly, always ranking last in average scores. In addition, models seem to benefit more from minimal pipelines without artifact handling methods.

To enhance the decoding accuracy of motor imagery EEG signals, this paper proposes a novel machine learning framework composed of three main modules. Firstly, a multi-band spatial feature learning technique is devised to identify discriminative spatial features from different frequency ranges and aggregate them to exploit the crucial complementary information among them. Subsequently, to further optimize the extracted features, a regularized feature selection method based on Elastic Net is introduced. This method automates the selection of the most significant features by considering both the relationship between features and the objective task, as well as the inter-feature relationships, leading to a more comprehensive feature selection.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) can capture the electrical activity in the brain, which can be real-time in post-stroke rehabilitation monitoring. EEG signal consists of several variables, including motor imagery and asynchronous from the symmetric channel. Both are features of post-stroke patients that are frequently used from previous studies, among other variables. EEG signals recorded from many channels can enrich the information on activity in the brain, including stroke. Motor imagery as a variable that reflects the stroke also be dominant in specific channels. Likewise, the asymmetry of the channel pair is too. Each channel or channel pair has its characteristics that are useful in identification. Meanwhile, a suitable method for identifying interconnected signals in time sequences is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Therefore, to maintain the connectivity and take advantage of the EEG signal from multichannel, this paper proposed the Multiple RNN method in which each channel was processed by one network connected by a fusion function. The two variables - motor imagery variable and asynchronous of the symmetric channel pair are obtained from the Wavelet transform. The motor imagery feature involves FC5 and FC6 channels, while the asynchronous channel involves the AF3-AF4, F7-F8, F3-F4, FC5-FC6, T7-T8, P7-P8, and O1-O2 channel pairs. Both variables were obtained from the EEG signal using Wavelet at 1–7 Hz for asynchronous channel pairs and 8 – 30 Hz for motor imagery. The results showed that the Multiple RNN provided an accuracy of 88.04%, which increased by 8% compared to a Single RNN which obtained an accuracy of 80.09%. The results also showed the importance of choosing a learning rate to get the best accuracy.","","978-1-6654-4288-6","10.1109/IC2IE53219.2021.9649392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9649392","post-stroke;EEG signal;asynchronous channel pairs;motor imagery;wavelet filter;multiple RNN","Wavelet transforms;Electrodes;Recurrent neural networks;Image recognition;Correlation;Stroke (medical condition);Electroencephalography","","2","","28","IEEE","27 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Event Related desynchronization / synchronization (ERD/ERS) was calculated to assess changes in alpha peak frequency in two moments: between 0.5 and 1.5 s (E1), and between 1.5 and 2.5 s (E2) after trigger sound of imagery start. The athletes showed more number of subjects with desynchronization in central areas, while in non-athletes in parietal areas ones. Moreover, the KMI along time analysis indicated more desynchronism in E2 than E1 in athletes, except for P3.

The performance of most electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models depends on the characteristics of specific subjects and periods, which require calibration and training with annotated data prior to application. However, this situation will become unacceptable as it would be difficult for subjects to collect data for an extended period, especially in the rehabilitation process of disability based on motor imagery (MI). To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework called iterative self-training multisubject domain adaptation (ISMDA) that focuses on the offline MI task. First, the feature extractor is purposefully designed to map the EEG to a latent space of discriminative representations. Second, the attention module based on dynamic transfer matches the source domain and target domain samples with a higher coincidence degree in latent space. Then, an independent classifier oriented to the target domain is employed in the first stage of the iterative training process to cluster the samples of the target domain through similarity. Finally, a pseudolabel algorithm based on certainty and confidence is employed in the second stage of the iterative training process to adequately calibrate the error between prediction and empirical probabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, extensive testing has been performed on three publicly available MI datasets, the BCI IV IIa, the High gamma dataset, and Kwon et al. datasets. The proposed method achieved 69.51%, 82.38%, and 90.98% cross-subject classification accuracy on the three datasets, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art offline algorithms. Meanwhile, all results demonstrated that the proposed method could address the main challenges of the offline MI paradigm.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3243339","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873181,61922062); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China(grant numbers:21JCJQJC00130); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049147","Brain-computer interface (BCI);dynamic transfer;electroencephalogram (EEG);iterative self-training;motor imagery (MI);unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Iterative methods;Filtering;Filter banks","Humans;Electroencephalography;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Imagination;Algorithms;Neural Networks, Computer;Movement;Brain","6","","57","IEEE","20 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the leading choice for designing BCIs due to its affordability, convenience to use, and implementation simplicity. Motor Imagery (MI), which is merely the imagination of motory tasks without physically performing them, is one of the most common techniques within EEG-based BCIs. Despite the width of MI applications, researchers typically face two groups of subjects; Some subjects imagine repeating the requested movement during the response intervals (epoch), while some others might execute the mental imagination of the activity only once, and not necessarily consistently within equal intervals after the stimulus is presented. The paper focuses on this challenge and proposes an adaptive framework which finds the time interval of subject's concentration on the MI task through three different scenarios. The proposed framework trims the epochs in a way that the irrelevant information within each epoch is discarded as the remainder illustrates the maximum performance of the subject in each trial. The framework is benchmarked on datasets retrieved from BCI Competition III-IVa and the results exhibit significant improvement against its counterparts.","","978-1-7281-1295-4","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2018.8646445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8646445","Electroencephalography (EEG);Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI);Motor Imagery (MI).","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Covariance matrices;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Brain-computer interfaces;Electrodes;Scalp","","2","","26","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such alterations include a change in concentration levels commonly recognized as being indicated by the alpha rhythm, drowsiness or mental fatigue which occurs during EEG signal acquisition. Change in mental state give rise to a challenge of variability in EEG characteristics across sessions and subjects. Consequently, this variability constitutes to low intention detection rate (IDR) that renders BCI performance unreliable. This study investigates the impact of multiple factors that lead to the poor performance of the EEG-BCI. Five factors 1) concentration level; 2) selection of independent components(IC); 3) inter-session variability; 4) inter-subject variability; and 5) classification methods on the IDR in EEG based BCI. The alpha rhythm, as the indicator of concentration level, is validated, and the relationship between the alpha rhythm and the IDR is studied among sessions. In addition, ICs are examined to determine their effects on the IDR across sessions. The possibility of two sessions to contain similar EEG characteristics is also examined, where both sessions are acquired from the same subject in different days. Moreover, the possibility of two different subjects to containing similar EEG characteristics is examined. Furthermore, to conquer the challenge of variability in EEG dynamics a feature transfer learning (TL) approach is proposed in this study. Furthermore, three classification methods (TL, K-NN and NB) are examined and compared to determine whether multi-source neural information can improve the classification accuracy of individual sessions or subjects. Three EEG datasets acquired using different paradigms are used for experiments. The datasets include steady state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP), motor imagery (MI) and BCI competition IV-a dataset. Experimental results have shown that selection of independent components has an effect on the IDR. In this case IC-2 and IC-11 achieved a lowest and highest accuracies of 51% and 100% for SSMVEP datasets, while IC-9 and the double-component (IC-2 and IC-13) achieved a lowest and highest accuracies of 40% and 69% for MI datasets respectively. The second experiment demonstrated that higher alpha rhythm, depicted by a lower IDR corresponds to a lower concentration level. While a lower alpha rhythm depicted by a higher IDR corresponds to a higher concentration level. Moreover, variability within sessions can significantly deteriorate intention detection rate across sessions. As such a decline in accuracy from 82% to 61%, and from 56% to 44% was observed across both SSMVEP and MI sessions during inter-session experiment respectively. Integration of samples from different sessions but same subject resulted in a highest accuracy of 65%, 59% and 40% for SSMVEP, MI and BCI competition dataset. Integration of samples from different subjects resulted in a highest accuracy of 65%, 44% and 48% for SSMVEP, BCI competition and MI datasets. When three classifiers are evaluated and compared to determine whether multi-source neural information can improve the classification accuracy of individual sessions and subjects or domains, both K-NN and NB achieved highest accuracies of 59% and 52% respectively, while TL showed a significant increase with an accuracy of 98% achieved using SSMVEP sessions. In a similarly manner both K-NN and NB achieved highest accuracies of 49%and 42%respectively using SSMVEP subjects,while TL showed a significant increasewith an accuracy of 64% achieved. Furthermore, when 9 MI subjects acquired from BCI competition dataset were used, both K-NN and NB achieved highest accuracies of 68% and 65% respectively, while a significant increase in accuracy was observed when TL is used with accuracy of 99% achieved. In conclusion, the change of alpha rhythm magnitude among sessions significantly affect the IDR across sessions. While component selection across sessions has significant effects due to non-linear and non-stationary nature of EEGsignals.Moreover,merging of ICs fromdifferent sessions, and inter-subject factor introduce challenges of overfitting resulting in low IDR. The classification methods are also found critical, because some advanced classification methods can improve the classification accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3205734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885203","Brain computer interface (BCI);alpha rhythm;motor imagery (MI);steady state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP);inter-session variability;inter-subject variability;transfer learning (TL)","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Band-pass filters;Integrated circuits;Brain-computer interfaces;Rhythm;Information filters;Visualization;Transfer learning","","6","","56","CCBY","12 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome this, an end-to-end classification network is designed, incorporating TSM for interacting with EEG information at different time points and attention mechanism for emphasizing important information. The model is validated using the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset and compared against methods like FBCSP and EEGNet. Experimental results demonstrate the model's superior performance, achieving approximately 10% improvement over FBCSP and an average accuracy increase of 4% compared to EEGNet.

This is because their residual muscles cannot provide sufficient myoelectric signals to accurately recognize limb movement intentions. One of the major challenges of BCI based EEG methods is the inevitable artifacts contained in multi-channels EEG recordings that would affect accurate characterization and decoding of limb movement intents from brain signals. Previous studies have applied different methods based on regression, blind source separation (BSS) and filtering techniques, though with limited efficacy in fully isolating artifacts from the entire EEG signals. Also, some of the existing methods are targeted towards the removal of one or two particular types of artifacts. In this study, a linear algorithm based on generalized eigenvalue decomposition and multi-channel Wiener filter (GEVD-MWF) was proposed to simultaneously remove different type of artifacts inherent in EEG signals, recorded from four transhumeral amputee subjects. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the commonly used approach which achieved an improved average classification accuracy of 22.03% across all the classes of motor imagery (MI) tasks and subjects. For real-time applications, a modified channel selection algorithm-based on sequential forward floating selection (mSFFS) was adopted to remove redundant channels and an average accuracy of 96.87% was achieved with 10 electrode channels located at the pre-motor cortex, primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex of the brain. The overall performance of the proposed method suggested that multiclass MI tasks can be reliably and accurately characterized using artifact-free EEG signals from a few number of channels. Thus, the proposed methods can be a potential control method for rehabilitation devices for individuals with high level amputation.","2152-744X","978-1-7281-6416-8","10.1109/ICMA49215.2020.9233834","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233834","Amputation;Artifact removal;Electroencephalography signals;Classifiers;Multi-channel Wiener filter","Wiener filters;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Brain-computer interfaces;Blind source separation;Real-time systems;Decoding","","1","","17","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes spiking neural network (SNN) classification method of motor imagery EEG signals. Firstly, the raw EEG signal is preprocessed by band-pass filtering, and encoded into spike signals by Ben’s Spike encoding algorithm. Then, convolution layers and pooling layer is designed in SNN to take advantage of the characteristics of EEG signal. Finally, the SNN is employed to classify the spike signals. It is worth noting that the activation function in SNN is different from the convolutional neural network. It simulates biological encode information of brain in the form of spikes by the LIF model. By simulating the change process of membrane potential, it realizes the transmission of intercellular spikes and the active release of membrane potential without input, which makes the signal processing closer to the neuron cell membrane potential processing mechanism. On the other hand, since spike signals can weaken the negative effect of noise in the superposition process, spikes input can reduce the influence of noise in the network. The BCI Competition IV 2a datasets are used in the experiments, and the classification results show that the proposed classification method achieves the average classification accuracy of 82.08%.","","979-8-3503-0439-8","10.1109/ICNC-FSKD59587.2023.10281037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10281037","","Training;Neurons;Membrane potentials;Signal processing algorithms;Pattern classification;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","","","17","IEEE","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, we observed significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) in β-band (15-30 Hz) over the motor cortex during both motor execution and motor imagery tasks. We applied linear correlation analysis to explore functional connectivity and found that motor execution and motor imagery share the similar connectivity pattern in the β-band at the beginning of the motor-task.

On the one hand, raw EEG signal is the timing signal of multiple electrodes, so it's impossible to extract local features like a picture using convolutional filters. On the other hand, EEG data collection is rather cumbersome, so the amount of EEG data is much smaller than some large datasets such as ImageNet, which leads to deeper network more prone to overfitting on EEG datasets. In this paper, we propose a method for processing resting state EEG signals, which uses Fourier transform to convert time-series EEG signals into frequency-domain signals, and construct a CNN model according to the characteristics of EEG signal. We applied this method to personal identification and classification of gender and age. For personal identification, we achieved an accuracy of 95.5% on our dataset, and the accuracy of gender and age classification was 62.7% and 51.2% respectively.","","978-1-7281-0084-5","10.1109/ICNSC.2019.8743338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743338","convolutional neural network;resting state EEG;signal analysis","Electroencephalography;Convolution;Brain modeling;Kernel;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Data models","","","","19","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a generative model is posited as the generating process behind bandpassed traces. In particular, the inputs are conceived as the state variable of a switching mechanism that samples temporal snippets from two distributions corresponding to a background component and a phasic event or wave packet counterpart. In order to non-linearly separate the sources, we propose a neurophysiologically principled, non- linear mapping to a space of ℓ2-norms via the Embedding Transform. In this way, the estimated phasic event component- an ideal time series where neuromodulations are emphasized- is isolated for further processing. The algorithm is tested on the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition 4 dataset 2a. The results not only surpass classic power-based measures, but also highlight the discriminative nature of scale-specific wave packets in motor imagery tasks. The inherent switching mechanism that generates the traces suggests a transient, temporally sparse feature of the neuromodulations that can be further exploited in applications where compression is advantageous.","1948-3554","978-1-5386-7921-0","10.1109/NER.2019.8716991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8716991","BCI;EEG;Embedding Transform;Wave Packets","Electroencephalography;Transforms;Task analysis;Brain modeling;Neuromodulation;Transient analysis;Image coding","","","","19","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combination of source-imaging and analysis of cortical directional networks enables us to noninvasively explore the underlying neural processes. However, existing EEG source imaging approaches mainly focus on performing the direct inverse operation for source estimation, which will be inevitably influenced by noise and the strategy used to find the inverse solution. Here, we develop a new source imaging technique, Deep Brain Neural Network (DeepBraiNNet), for robust sparse spatiotemporal EEG source estimation. In DeepBraiNNet, considering that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are usually “deep” in temporal dimension and thus suitable for time sequence modelling, the RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized to approximate the inverse operation for the lead field matrix instead of performing the direct inverse operation, which avoids the possible effect of the direct inverse operation on the underdetermined lead field matrix prone to be influenced by noise. Simulations on various source patterns and noise conditions confirmed that the proposed approach could actually recover the spatiotemporal sources well, outperforming existing state of-the-art methods. DeepBraiNNet also estimated sparse MI related activation patterns when it was applied to a real Motor Imagery dataset, consistent with other findings based on EEG and fMRI. Based on the spatiotemporal sources estimated from DeepBraiNNet, we constructed MI related cortical neural networks, which clearly exhibited strong contralateral network patterns for the two MI tasks. Consequently, DeepBraiNNet may provide an alternative way different from the conventional approaches for spatiotemporal EEG source imaging.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2021.3097758","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19A2082,61961160705,81771925,71601136); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2018JY0526); ARC DECRA Fellowship(grant numbers:DE220100265); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488247","Cortical neural networks;long short-term memory network;EEG source imaging;spatiotemporal EEG sources","Electroencephalography;Imaging;Scalp;Lead;Deep learning;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Inverse problems","Brain;Electroencephalography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer","25","","62","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Benefiting from the proposed metric learning based label estimation strategy, sampling criterion and progressive learning scheme, the proposed framework efficiently extracts distinctive feature embedding from the unlabeled EEG samples and achieves a 5.40% improvement on BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa with 80% unlabeled samples and an average 3.35% improvement on two public BCI datasets. By employing synchronous EMG features as pseudo labels for the unlabeled EEG samples, the proposed framework further extracts deep level features of the synergistic complementarity between the EEG signals and EMG features based on the deep encoders, which improves the performance of hybrid BCI (with a 5.53% improvement for the Upper Limb Motion Dataset and an average 4.34% improvement on two hybrid datasets). Moreover, the ablation experiments show that the proposed framework can substantially improve the performance of the deep encoders (with an average 5.53% improvement). The proposed framework not only largely improves the performance of deep networks in the BCI system, but also significantly reduces the calibration time for EEG-EMG fusion analysis, which shows great potential for building an efficient and high-performance hybrid BCI for the motor rehabilitation process.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3192448","Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2021SHZDZX0100); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:19441908000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832942","EEG classification;EEG-EMG fusion;progressive learning;semi-supervised learning;brain computer interface","Synchronous motors;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Electromyography;Feature extraction;Training","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Humans;Imagination;Supervised Machine Learning","4","","47","CCBY","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce this computational burden due to the large number of channels, an iterative multiobjective optimization for channel selection (IMOCS) is proposed in this paper. For a given MI classification task, the proposed method initializes a reference candidate solution and subsequently finds a set of the most relevant channels in an iterative manner by exploiting both the anatomical and functional relevance of EEG channels. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Wadsworth dataset for the right fist versus left fist MI tasks, while considering the cross-validation accuracy as the performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, 12 other dimension reduction and channel selection algorithms are used for benchmarking. The proposed approach (IMOCS) achieved an average classification accuracy of about 80% when evaluated using 35 best-performing subjects. One-way analysis of variance revealed the statistical significance of the proposed approach with at least 7% improvement over other benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, a cross-subject generalization of channel selection on untrained subjects shows that the subject-independent channels perform as good as using all channels achieving an average classification accuracy of 61%.

In order to solve the problem, in this study, we propose a novel method named Riemannian sparse optimization and Dempster-Shafer fusion of multi-time-frequency patterns (RSODSF) to enhance the decoding efficiency. First, we effectively combine the Riemannian geometry of the spatial covariance matrix with sparse optimization to extract more robust and distinct features. Second, the Dempster-Shafer theory is introduced and used to fuse each time window after sparse optimization of Riemannian features. Besides, the probabilistic values of the support vector machine (SVM) are obtained and transformed to effectively fuse multiple classifiers to leverage potential soft information of multiple trained SVM. The open-access BCI Competition IV dataset IIa and Competition III dataset IIIa are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed RSODSF. It achieves higher average accuracy (89.7% and 96.8%) than state-of-the-art methods.

We compare various feature extraction techniques by combining common spatial pattern (CSP) with several features: variance, energy, entropy and logarithmic band power (LBP). Three types of classifiers were employed for classification: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). We tested our proposed method using data recorded from 17 subjects, provided by BCI-Competition III and IV.

Their deployment in real-time applications, however, requires highly parallel and capable computing platforms like GPUs to achieve high-speed inference, consuming a large amount of energy. In this paper, we explore a custom deep learning accelerator on an off-the-shelf hybrid FPGA device to achieve similar inference performance at a fraction of the energy consumption. We evaluate different optimisations at bit-level, data-path and training using a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network as our baseline model to arrive at our custom precision quantised deep learning model, which is implemented using the FINN compiler from Xilinx. The accelerator, deployed on a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, achieves a significant reduction in power consumption (≈ 17×), sub 2 ms decoding latency and a near-identical decoding accuracy (statistically insignificant reduction of 2.5% average) as the reported baseline subject-specific classification accuracy on an N (= 54) subject motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) dataset compared to the Deep CNN model on GPU, making our approach more appealing for low-power real-time BCI applications.

Cross-day decoding showed that CNN was able to achieve a 2-class (right vs. idle) classification accuracy of 68.38±7.29% and 65.94±8.52% with 2D and 3D kernels respectively, compared to 55.09±5.74 % for the traditionally used filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method.

Multivariable BCI actions add features to drive external devices from the brain directly. Each variable EEG signal has its characteristics, including the frequency band. Therefore, processing each variable as a separate network is an appropriate choice. One method often used to identify data series such as EEG signals is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

Hybrid BCI systems using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have received significant attention for overcoming the limitations of EEG- and fNIRS-standalone BCI systems. However, most hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI studies have focused on late fusion because of discrepancies in their temporal resolutions and recording locations. Despite the enhanced performance of hybrid BCIs, late fusion methods have difficulty in extracting correlated features in both EEG and fNIRS signals. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a deep learning-based early fusion structure, which combines two signals before the fully-connected layer, called the fNIRS-guided attention network (FGANet). First, 1D EEG and fNIRS signals were converted into 3D EEG and fNIRS tensors to spatially align EEG and fNIRS signals at the same time point. The proposed fNIRS-guided attention layer extracted a joint representation of EEG and fNIRS tensors based on neurovascular coupling, in which the spatially important regions were identified from fNIRS signals, and detailed neural patterns were extracted from EEG signals. Finally, the final prediction was obtained by weighting the sum of the prediction scores of the EEG and fNIRS-guided attention features to alleviate performance degradation owing to delayed fNIRS response. In the experimental results, the FGANet significantly outperformed the EEG-standalone network. Furthermore, the FGANet has 4.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms in mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks, respectively.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3149899","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020M3C1B8081320,2020R1C1C1011857); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706459","Brain-computer interface (BCI);deep learning;electroencephalography (EEG);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);hybrid BCI;fNIRS-guided attention networks","Electroencephalography;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Tensors;Task analysis;Electrodes","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans","38","","57","CCBY","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper first exposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in EEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the same user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information. To address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the original EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user identity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI task.

Existing transfer learning approaches usually make use of the source-domain data directly in target model learning. To protect the privacy of the source subjects, we propose lightweight source-free transfer (LSFT), which first generates source models locally and encapsulates them as model application programming interfaces (APIs), then constructs a virtual intermediate domain to transfer the knowledge in the source domains to the target domain, and finally performs feature adaptation learning. Compared with the existing deep transfer learning approaches, LSFT does not need to transfer from massive source data or models, is computationally efficient, and has a small number of parameters. Experiments on four benchmark MI data sets demonstrated that LSFT outperformed 13 different approaches, including several state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that make use of the source-domain samples or model parameters directly.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2022.3193731","Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFA050); CCF-AFSG Research(grant numbers:CCF-AFSG RF20210007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9840893","Brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);motor imagery (MI);privacy protection;transfer learning","Brain modeling;Transfer learning;Data models;Covariance matrices;Electroencephalography;Adaptation models;Computational modeling","","17","","66","IEEE","26 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performance of four different feature extraction methods [power spectral density (PSD), phase locking value (PLV), a combination of PSD and PLV, and cross-correlation (CC)] were evaluated in terms of robustness to electrode location changes as well as regarding absolute classification accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, whereas PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features.

To mitigate the client drift issue, we then explicitly connect the learning across multiple clients by aligning their corresponding virtual class centers, thus helping to correct the local training for individual subject.

Motor imagery (MI)-BCI, which decodes EEG signals induced by the user's imagination of moving body parts, has gained great attention due to its applicability in various fields such as robotics and rehabilitation. MI - EEG signals exhibit class-discriminative patterns such as event-related de/synchronization across spectral-spatio-temporal (SST) domains. Numerous studies adopted deep learning framework, especially convolutional neural network (CNN), for learning SST feature representations automatically in a data-driven manner. In particular, most of the CNN-based methods adopted temporal convolution to learn the spectral information, as it can act as a band-pass filter. In this paper, we propose SAT-Net, a SincNet-based attentive temporal convolutional network for motor imagery classification. The proposed method utilizes Sinc convolution from SincNet for explicit extraction of spectral information from the input EEG signals with high interpretability. Moreover, we adopt an attentive temporal convolutional network to effectively learn SST feature representations while making full use of temporal information. We evaluate our proposed SAT-Net on the public BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, comparing it not only to conventional CNN-based approaches but also to the state-of-the-art method.

The mainstream DL methodology for the MI-EEG classification exploits the temporospatial patterns of EEG signals using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been particularly successful in visual images. However, since the statistical characteristics of visual images depart radically from EEG signals, a natural question arises whether an alternative network architecture exists apart from CNNs. To address this question, we propose a novel geometric DL (GDL) framework called Tensor-CSPNet, which characterizes spatial covariance matrices derived from EEG signals on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and fully captures the temporospatiofrequency patterns using existing deep neural networks on SPD manifolds, integrating with experiences from many successful MI-EEG classifiers to optimize the framework. In the experiments, Tensor-CSPNet attains or slightly outperforms the current state-of-the-art performance on the cross-validation and holdout scenarios in two commonly used MI-EEG datasets. Moreover, the visualization and interpretability analyses also exhibit the validity of Tensor-CSPNet for the MI-EEG classification.

As a result, there is often poor task detection accuracy and high error rates in designed brain-computer interfacing (BCI) systems. In this paper, a novel preprocessing method is proposed to automatically reconstruct the EEG signal by selecting the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on a median frequency measure. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose the EEG signals into a set of IMFs.

This paper delves into an innovative and sophisticated EEG signal processing model, which employs three distinct combinations of EEG electrodes, four advanced feature extraction methods, and four cutting-edge classification algorithms, in conjunction with an adaptive multivariate chirp mode decomposition (AMCMD) for the analysis of motor imagery EEG signals. The feasibility of this novel approach is corroborated through its successful application to a sizable GigaDB dataset comprising 52 participants, as well as the challenging BCI competition III datasets IVa and IVb. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the seamless integration of the AMCMD mechanism with an 18-electrode combination, spectral features, and a multilayer neural network classifier engenders remarkably robust and discriminating classification outcomes. The classification accuracy for dataset IVa and IVb subjects attains an impressive pinnacle, reaching 99.70%, 99.88%, 99.88%, 99.87%, 100%, and 94.98%, respectively. Furthermore, when scrutinizing the GigaDB dataset, the average classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1score exhibit commendable values of 82.71%, 82.76%, 83.04%, and 82.80%, respectively. These salient findings, juxtaposed against the backdrop of earlier studies, decisively manifest a striking 15.4% enhancement in average classification accuracy, irrefutably affirming the exceptional prowess of the proposed model. Consequently, the compelling evidence culminates in the conclusion that the adaptive AMCMD method stands resolutely robust, adept, and universally adaptive in its ability to proficiently classify EEG signals, deftly circumventing subject-to-subject variability across diverse and extensive datasets.","","979-8-3503-1401-4","10.1109/ICICN59530.2023.10392442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10392442","Electroencephalogram;Machine Learning;Brain-Computer Interface;Artificial Intelligence","Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Sensitivity;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Rendering (computer graphics);Electroencephalography","","","","25","IEEE","24 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, Machine Learning (ML) techniques were assessed using features based on Power Spectral Density (PSD) in the mu (μ, 8–13 Hz) and beta (β, 13–30 Hz) frequency bands. Four distinct classifiers were explored: Kernel Naive Bayes (NB), Quadratic Support Vector Machine (QSVM), Fine k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). These classifiers were employed to discriminate between open- and closed-hand MI tasks. Based on the evaluated metrics, it was concluded that the implemented methodology is feasible for classifying MI tasks from the same limb, where the QSVM classifier showed the most promising results, with a mean accuracy of approximately 75%.

Effective extraction of spectral-spatial-temporal features is crucial for MI decoding from limited and low signal-to-noise ratio electroencephalogram (EEG) signal samples based on brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, we propose a lightweight Multi-Feature Attention Neural Network (M-FANet) for feature extraction and selection of multi-feature data. M-FANet employs several unique attention modules to eliminate redundant information in the frequency domain, enhance local spatial feature extraction and calibrate feature maps. We introduce a training method called Regularized Dropout (R-Drop) to address training-inference inconsistency caused by dropout and improve the model’s generalization capability. We conduct extensive experiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a (BCIC-IV-2a) dataset and the 2019 World robot conference contest-BCI Robot Contest MI (WBCIC-MI) dataset. M-FANet achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MI decoding methods, with 79.28% 4-class classification accuracy (kappa: 0.7259) on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset and 77.86% 3-class classification accuracy (kappa: 0.6650) on the WBCIC-MI dataset.

EEG signals related to imagination of six tasks that involved three limbs (left and right index fingers and right toes) and two speeds were first separated from original EEG signals mixed with noises by ICA. Then, event-related EEG trials were superposed and averaged to get time domain average EEG that was decomposed by wavelet transform to investigate phase locked event-related oscillations. Event-related EEG trials were also decomposed by wavelet transform respectively and then superposed and averaged to investigate non-phase-locked event related oscillations. In addition, power spectra for selected channel were calculated by FFT. By these methods, the latency of 50~536ms and the low frequency band of 2.7~8Hz for an increase in power early after the event, latencies and frequency bands for significant different changes and a different degree decrease in power at high frequency band between fast and slow motor imagery, and ERD / ERS in a broad frequency band for selected channels were found. Simultaneously extracting phase-locked and non-phase-locked event-related oscillations in broadband range may be very important for acquiring complete information about event-related EEG during motor imagery with speed parameters.
