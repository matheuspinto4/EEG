Using a computerized visual-motor task similar to mirror drawing, our work demonstrated that overall EEG activities in all frequency bands decreased with an increase in motor task familiarity. In particular, frontal EEG activities in delta band of the whole trial and gamma band at the beginning of each trial are having a significant negative relationship with the overall familiarity level of the task. The findings suggest that frontal EEG spectra are significantly modulated during motor skill acquisition.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610829","Electroencephalography (EEG);familiarity;visual-motor task;mirror drawing;forehead","Electroencephalography;Accuracy;Indexes;Mirrors;Monitoring;Coherence;Correlation","Adult;Electroencephalography;Humans;Learning;Motor Skills;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","6","","13","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the non-stationary nature of many processes in nature, it is important to apply and improve methods for analyzing the structure of experimental processes in the dynamics of systems with time-varied characteristics. One of the most popular approaches is wavelet analysis and methods that use decomposition in the basis of wavelet functions as the main or intermediate stage of analysis. In this study, various versions of extended multiresolution wavelet analysis (MWA) were tested, aimed at improving the quality of diagnostics of complex oscillations and their changes when the operating conditions of the system change. The characterization of differences between various group using the kurtosis and skewness of the probability distribution of the wavelet coefficients of decompositions improves the diagnosis of age distinctions compared to the approach based on the standard deviations.","2770-744X","978-1-6654-6174-0","10.1109/DCNA56428.2022.9923065","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923065","EEG;motor tasks;wavelets;multiresolution analysis;cumulants","Wavelet analysis;Probability distribution;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Older adults;Nonlinear systems;Signal resolution","","","","11","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical cortico-peripheral interaction measures include corticomuscular coupling and corticokinematic coupling (CKC). Functional CKC reflects movement-related proprioceptive inputs, it could be through kinematics and physiological signals. The process consists of both linear and nonlinear properties of the whole neuromotor control system. Previous studies mainly applied linear techniques to assess the functional coupling between the cortex and periphery, but the nonlinear coupling properties were rarely discussed. In this preliminary study, 128 channels of electroencephalography (EEG) and 3-axis acceleration (ACC) signals were acquired for both dominant and non-dominant hand in four healthy participants during passive finger movement stimulus. Corticokinematic coherence and partial directed coherence analysis was performed to investigate linear coupling and directionality between EEG and ACC during movement, special concerns were focused at stimulus frequency (3Hz) and its harmonics. Further, we utilized phase transfer entropy to characterize top-down and bottom-up nonlinear cortico-peripheral information flow, and for the first time, we found typical nonlinear coupling patterns between the cortex and periphery during passive movement tasks. Such results might facilitate our understanding of human sensorimotor control system and imply potential clinical applications.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123763","corticokinematic coupling;nonlinear neural coupling;phase transfer entropy","Couplings;Propioception;Process control;Neural engineering;Coherence;Control systems;Entropy","","","","19","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, movement intention reduces mu (8-13 Hz) oscillation amplitude over the sensorimotor cortex, a phenomenon referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD). In an ERD-contingent assistance paradigm, initial BCI-enhanced robotic therapy studies have used ERD to provide robotic assistance for movement. Here we investigated how ERD changed as a function of audio-visual stimuli, overt movement from the participant, and robotic assistance. Twelve unimpaired subjects played a computer game designed for rehabilitation therapy with their fingers using the FINGER robotic exoskeleton. In the game, the participant and robot matched movement timing to audio-visual stimuli in the form of notes approaching a target on the screen set to the consistent beat of popular music. The audio-visual stimulation of the game alone did not cause ERD, before or after training. In contrast, overt movement by the subject caused ERD, whether or not the robot assisted the finger movement. Notably, ERD was also present when the subjects remained passive and the robot moved their fingers to play the game. This ERD occurred in anticipation of the passive finger movement with similar onset timing as for the overt movement conditions. These results demonstrate that ERD can be contingent on expectation of robotic assistance; that is, the brain generates an anticipatory ERD in expectation of a robot-imposed but predictable movement. This is a caveat that should be considered in designing BCIs for enhancing patient effort in robotically-assisted therapy.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2528167","National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405355","Brain–computer interface (BCI);man machine systems;rehabilitation robotics","Fingers;Medical treatment;Robot sensing systems;Games;Electroencephalography;Timing","","35","","45","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been shown that imagination leads to the activation of the brain areas as motor learning. This preliminary study tested a hypothesis whether motor planning and execution change by different brain regions and a reaching-and-grasping MI task for both dominant and nondominant side upper limbs. Results show that for both sides, brain regions’ activations change similarly, before and after movement on-site with statistically significant differences occur throughout the motor strip (left and right) and around the visual cortex. This suggests that for people who have not MI trained before, brain activation is similar regardless of the dominant side of the limb.","","978-1-5386-5340-1","10.1109/BIYOMUT.2017.8479241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479241","","Task analysis;Planning;Electroencephalography;Brain;Electrodes;Protocols;Visualization","","","","","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research studied pre-movement EEG from shoulder-elbow movement in stroke survivors to identify signal characteristics potentially useful for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation. Pre-movement event-related desynchronization (ERD) was examined in the alpha band mu rhythm for control (n = 7) and stroke subjects (n = 11). Subjects were all right-hand dominant; stroke subjects used their impaired arm and controls were assigned a side to match stroke subjects. Both non-dominant-arm-tested stroke and control subjects exhibited greater ERD intensity vs. those using their dominant arm (p < 0.05). Also, pre-movement ERD was detected in stroke survivors, which suggests at the possibility of using ERD as a BCI system control signal. However, the peak ERD of stroke survivors was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (p < 0.05), which brings doubt to whether the intensity of ERD in stroke survivors is large enough to be used as a BCI system control signal","1050-4729","0-7803-9505-0","10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1642182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642182","","Electroencephalography;Rehabilitation robotics;Medical treatment;Control systems;Computer science;Brain computer interfaces;Signal processing;Neural prosthesis;Couplings;Registers","","8","","22","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
